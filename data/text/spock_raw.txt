SPOCK: Check the circuit. 
SPOCK: It can't be the screen then. Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way. 
SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. SS Columbia. It disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. 
SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Spock here.
SPOCK: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read? 
SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, and probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
SPOCK: They may simply be studying the Captain, to find out how Earth people are put together. Or it could be something more. 
SPOCK: Look. Brains three times the size of ours. If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power is so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
SPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
SPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power.
SPOCK: We've located a magnetic field that seems to come from their underground generator.
SPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
SPOCK: The women! 
SPOCK: Address intercraft. 
SPOCK: This is the acting captain speaking. We have no choice now but to consider the safety of this vessel and the remainder of the crew. We're leaving. All decks prepare for hyperdrive. Time warp factor. 
SPOCK: Engine room! 
SPOCK: Mister Spock here. Switch to rockets. We're blasting out. 
SPOCK: Nothing. But for the batteries we'd lose gravitation and oxygen. 
SPOCK: Could be we've waited too long. It's collecting all the information stored in this fly. They've decided to swat us. 
SPOCK: Mister Spock here.
SPOCK: Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this planet, Captain. Gravity is one point one of Earth, atmosphere within safety limits.
SPOCK: It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation techniques. 
SPOCK: That's an unusual request. 
SPOCK: You're certain you recognise his voice? 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain.
SPOCK [OC]: Any problems, Captain? 
SPOCK: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK: We were becoming concerned, Captain. Your check-in was overdue and since we'd not heard from your security team 
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? You sound tired. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right? 
SPOCK: Captain! 
SPOCK: Captain, We finished ahead of schedule. 
SPOCK: You're going back down with the command pack? 
SPOCK: Yes. very well, Captain. 
SPOCK: No problems here, sir. 
SPOCK: Security, Spock here. Status of your landing party? 
SPOCK: Have them meet me in the transporter room after the Captain has beamed down. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk! 
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?
SPOCK: Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated expression. 
SPOCK: I have them, Captain. Closing off deck fourteen, search in progress. 
SPOCK: Negative in the deck area, Captain. He may have gotten out. Expanding search to adjoining sections.
SPOCK: Interesting. Your Earth people glorify organised violence for forty centuries, but you imprison those who employ it privately.
SPOCK: We disposed of emotion, Doctor. Where there is no emotion there is no motive for violence.&nbsp;
SPOCK: Fifty seven minutes, thirty seconds, Captain.
SPOCK: An identification tape from our ship's library on Doctor Simon Van Gelder.
SPOCK: Doctor Van Gelder, Captain. No mistake. There's a full ID tape on him.
SPOCK: Assigned there six months ago as Doctor Adams' associate.
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I suggest you ask Doctor Adams if he wants Van Gelder returned.
SPOCK: I believe we should, Jim.
SPOCK: Problem, Captain?
SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise. Spock here.
SPOCK [OC]: Affirmative, Captain. Enterprise out. 
SPOCK: Neural neutraliser. Can you explain that, Doctor Van Gelder? 
SPOCK: This room. What happens there?
SPOCK: Can you give us your present location, Captain? 
SPOCK: Then you're with Doctor Adams now.
SPOCK: Captain, Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room. The term was neural neutraliser. 
SPOCK: Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger. 
SPOCK [OC]: Please repeat, Captain. I didn't receive that.
SPOCK: When do you plan to beam back up, Captain?
SPOCK: And you will continue to check in every four hours?
SPOCK: Destroy how? What? 
SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise log. First officer Spock, acting captain. I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe into Van Gelder's tortured mind. 
SPOCK: I've never used it on a human, Doctor. 
SPOCK: It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives.
SPOCK: It could be dangerous. Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.
SPOCK: This will not affect you, Doctor McCoy, only the person I touch. It is not hypnosis.
SPOCK: You begin to feel a strange euphoria. Your body floats.
SPOCK: Open your mind. We move together. Our minds sharing the same thoughts. 
SPOCK: What is our name? Who are we?
SPOCK: Doctor Adams. The neural neutraliser. What did he do to us?
SPOCK: Yes.
SPOCK: Yes.
SPOCK: Yes.
SPOCK: Yes.
SPOCK: Empty.
SPOCK: Lonely.
SPOCK: Empty.
SPOCK: Emergency channel D.
SPOCK: Keep trying.
SPOCK: (to McCoy) Get some security people and follow me down. Energise. 
SPOCK: (pushes a load of buttons) Enterprise, this is Spock. Force field has been eliminated. (turns main power back on again) 
SPOCK: It was from Van Gelder. He thought you'd like to know the treatment room had been dismantled and the equipment destroyed.
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Captain. Warp factor one. 
SPOCK: Not a vessel, a ground source. The third planet in this solar system, according to my instruments. 
SPOCK: Measuring the planet now, Captain. It's spheroid-shaped, circumference twenty four thousand eight hundred seventy four miles. Mass six times ten to the twenty first power tons. Mean density five point five one seven. Atmosphere oxygen, nitrogen. 
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. 
SPOCK: More the, er, mid-1900s I would say, Captain, approximately 1960. 
SPOCK: Readings indicate that natural deterioration has been taking place on this planet for at least several centuries. 
SPOCK: Not conclusive, Yeoman. The evidence would suggest that the distress signal is automated. 
SPOCK: Definitely humanoid, in spite of the distortion. 
SPOCK: About three hundred years. 
SPOCK: Right, Captain. 
SPOCK: Guards! Cover me. 
SPOCK: Children, Captain. Lots of them. We couldn't begin to get close to them. They just seemed to scurry away, like animals. Only children. 
SPOCK: Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages. Now there you have a museum piece, Doctor. (referring to microscope) Lens type, manually operated, light-activated. 
SPOCK: Progress report, genetics section, Life Prolongation Project. 
SPOCK: This was three hundred years ago, Captain. 
SPOCK: But children become adults. 
SPOCK: Doctor, there are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty, are there not? 
SPOCK: Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter puberty, contract the disease? 
SPOCK: It's illogical. It does not follow. All the adults on this planet died three hundred years ago, but there are children in the streets. 
SPOCK: There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain. 
SPOCK: She's becoming a woman. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Lieutenant. I have their calculations now. 
SPOCK: According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every one hundred years of real time. 
SPOCK: Exactly, Yeoman. Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, leaving only the children. 
SPOCK: Could very well be immensely old. 
SPOCK: Difficult, if we can't even get a glimpse of them. 
SPOCK: Impossible. They know the area too well, like mice. 
SPOCK: Is at least three hundred years older than you are, Yeoman. Think about it. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK: This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began. I disregard these last entries. He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have. The ship's computers will verify my figures. 
SPOCK: Our guess was correct. They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes. The notes would indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so. I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left. 
SPOCK: The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease. 
SPOCK: I am a carrier. Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain. 
SPOCK: I presume my calculations are correct. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Verified, Captain. We have seven days. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, they weren't successful. We've seen the results. 
SPOCK: No, nothing. 
SPOCK: Communicators, Captain, they're gone. 
SPOCK: The nitrogen cycle, it has to be. 
SPOCK: That is a very good question. 
SPOCK: That's not all, Captain. We've got to find those communicators. 
SPOCK: We've got to have those communicators, Jim. 
SPOCK: Without them, it could be a beaker full of death. 
SPOCK: We must. The vaccine could be fatal. 
SPOCK: Bickering is pointless. I'll check on the Captain's progress. 
SPOCK: Not yet. 
SPOCK: He injected himself with the vaccine. He was unconscious when I found him. 
SPOCK: The blemishes are fading. They're fading. Who will understand the medical mind? 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Warp factor one, Captain. 
SPOCK: A good empirical research scientist. Steady, reputable, occasionally brilliant. 
SPOCK: I have no information on that, Captain. We are ready to leave orbit. 
SPOCK: Ready to resume course, Captain. 
SPOCK: What kind? Personnel? Cargo? 
SPOCK: How did you know this lady was coming aboard? 
SPOCK: May I inquire as to our course, Captain? 
SPOCK: Benecia Colony is eight light years off our course. 
SPOCK: We'll arrive stardate 2825.3, Captain, approximately fifteen hundred Benecia time. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: He came up from engineering, Captain. 
SPOCK: Any explanation? He's a fine young officer. He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action. 
SPOCK: Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor. The Captain is acting strangely. I'm asking if you've noticed. 
SPOCK: My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol. 
SPOCK: It occurred. I dismissed it. 
SPOCK: Did you know that he suddenly transferred Lieutenant Riley to engineering? 
SPOCK: No, thank you. 
SPOCK: Full personal dossiers on the following names. Doctor Thomas Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley, and Captain James T. Kirk. 
SPOCK: Correlate. Check their past histories. Report any item, any past episode or experience they all have in common. 
SPOCK: I will continue, Doctor. According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus Four, when the food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus and largely destroyed. There were over eight thousand colonists and virtually no food. And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law. 
SPOCK: You may not have heard it all. Kodos began to separate the colonists. Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left. The remainder would be immediately put to death. Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics. 
SPOCK: Perhaps not. But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive and who would not, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy. Children watching their parents die. Whole families destroyed. Over four thousand people. They died quickly, without pain, but they died. Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions. And Kodos? There never was a positive identification of his body. 
SPOCK: His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared. 
SPOCK: He'd better. There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre, who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes. Jim Kirk was one of them. With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness is dead. And my library computer shows that wherever they were, on Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship, the Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near when they died. 
SPOCK: You've got to pull him through. 
SPOCK: If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the Captain. And he'll be the next target. 
SPOCK: Someone tried to poison him. 
SPOCK: I don't believe that and neither do you. I want the Captain to see that report. 
SPOCK: Now. 
SPOCK: Can we predict the same for you, Captain? 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Riley was a witness. So were you. 
SPOCK: Someone tried to kill him. 
SPOCK: You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor. I checked with the library computer, just as you did. I got the same information. 
SPOCK: Is my personal business when it might interfere with the smooth operation of this ship. 
SPOCK: It could happen. 
SPOCK: Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals four. Almost certainly an attempt will be made to kill you. Why do you invite death? 
SPOCK: He is. 
SPOCK: Logic, Captain. Doctor Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q. Now an attempt has been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Shh. Listen. Do you hear it? That low hum. 
SPOCK: On overload. (starts searching) 
SPOCK: You can't stay. 
SPOCK: Evacuate this section. Seal it off. Clear section C4 and C5. 
SPOCK: I believe we have a match, Captain. 
SPOCK: Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain. 
SPOCK: Power up. All instruments activated. All readings normal. All go. 
SPOCK: Position? 
SPOCK: Make up your mind please, Mister Latimer. 
SPOCK: Considerably, Mister Boma. 
SPOCK: Stop forward momentum, Mister Latimer. 
SPOCK: Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
SPOCK: Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. We are out of control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki three one two. Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull. Course three point two five 
SPOCK: I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mister Boma. 
SPOCK: Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mister Scott. I think you'll find your work is cut out for you. Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
SPOCK: I expect nothing, Mister Scott. It is merely logical to try all the alternatives. Doctor McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please. 
SPOCK: Just the facts, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Thank you for your opinion. It will be duly noted. You're recording this, Yeoman? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, if you'll make a survey of the damage, please. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I think we should move outside, make room for Mister Scott to do his work. Mister Latimer, Mister Gaetano, you'll arm yourselves and scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the ship. 
SPOCK: Under present conditions, extremely poor. 
SPOCK: If the ionisation effect is as widespread as I believe it is, Doctor, they'll be searching for us without instrumentation, by visual contact only. On those terms, this is a very large planet. 
SPOCK: Not as long as we're grounded. We may be here for a very long time, Doctor. 
SPOCK: My big chance? For what, Doctor? 
SPOCK: I am a logical man, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Perhaps, Doctor, but I know of no better way to begin. I realise command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as these. But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of it. It simply exists. And I will do whatever logically needs to be done. Excuse me. 
SPOCK: In what way? 
SPOCK: The weight of three grown men. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, with very few exceptions we use virtually every piece of equipment aboard this craft in attaining orbit. There's very little excess weight, except among the passengers. 
SPOCK: Unless the situation changes radically, yes. 
SPOCK: As commanding officer, the choice will be mine. 
SPOCK: A very quaint idea, Mister Boma, but I do believe I'm better qualified to make the selection than any random drawing of lots. 
SPOCK: My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical means. 
SPOCK: But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor. Now gentlemen, I suggest we move outside to make a further examination of the hull in the event we've overlooked any minor damage. 
SPOCK: Come on, Boma. 
SPOCK: What was it? 
SPOCK: (returns from investigating) Nothing there. 
SPOCK: I don't doubt your word. 
SPOCK: (pulling the bloody spear from Latimer's body and examining it) Folsom Point. 
SPOCK: There's a remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered in 1925, old world calendar, New Mexico, North America. A bit more crude about the shaft, I believe. Not very efficient. 
SPOCK: Am I in error, Mister Boma? 
SPOCK: Then what, Mister Boma? 
SPOCK: My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life, Mister Boma. 
SPOCK: Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts. If you need assistance, I 
SPOCK: Perhaps if you were to channel the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve. 
SPOCK: Excellent, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Which would still leave us at least one hundred and fifty pounds overweight. 
SPOCK: It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six, Doctor. 
SPOCK: You might be wise to start. 
SPOCK: For what? 
SPOCK: Mister Boma, we're working against time. 
SPOCK: Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion. 
SPOCK: My place is here. If you please, Doctor. 
SPOCK: By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our chances of staying alive. Well, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: What happened? 
SPOCK: That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind. Consider the alternatives, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, there are always alternatives. 
SPOCK: Wood rubbing on some kind of leather. 
SPOCK: Not a tribal culture. Their artefacts are too primitive. More likely a loose association of some sort. 
SPOCK: How, Mister Boma? 
SPOCK: I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for life. 
SPOCK: Mister Boma? 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy? 
SPOCK: It does, indeed. It seems logical to me, also. But to take life indiscriminately, 
SPOCK: I am not interested in the opinion of the majority, Mister Gaetano. Components must be weighed. Our danger to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not. There's a third course. 
SPOCK: I think not. Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK: You and Yeoman Mears return to the ship. Assist Mister Scott in any way possible. We'll be back shortly. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets. 
SPOCK: We'll fire to frighten, Mister Gaetano, not to kill. 
SPOCK: I am in command, Mister Gaetano. The orders and the responsibility will be mine. Follow me. 
SPOCK: I hear them. They're directly ahead of us. Several, I believe. Direct your phasers to two o'clock and to ten o'clock. 
SPOCK: Yes, I know. But fortunately, I'm giving the orders. Take aim please, and fire when I give a signal. 
SPOCK: Fire. (several seconds of sustained phaser beam) Cease fire. (It's gone quiet) They should think twice before bothering us again. 
SPOCK: It was not necessary. Fear will do for us what needs to be done. Mister Boma, you will return with me to the Galileo. Mister Gaetano, you remain on guard here. Keep in contact with the ship. 
SPOCK: Yes, we found them. They won't bother us again. 
SPOCK: Go, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply. 
SPOCK: They would also seem to be our only hope. 
SPOCK: (after brief thought) Yeoman, your phaser. 
SPOCK: They won't attack for at least several hours. By then, with luck, we'll be gone. 
SPOCK: We don't have to maintain it very long, Mister Scott. In less than twenty four hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous. If we can't maintain orbit after that time, it won't make any difference. If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die. Doctor, your phaser. Go to work, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Take this back to Mister Scott for conversion, please Doctor. 
SPOCK: (handing over his own phaser) And give this to Mister Scott in the event I don't return. 
SPOCK: I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mister Gaetano. Return to the ship, please. 
SPOCK: Most illogical reaction. We demonstrated our superior weapons. They should have fled. 
SPOCK: Of course. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability. 
SPOCK: They're studying us, for the moment. 
SPOCK: My opinion, Mister Boma. 
SPOCK: Seal the windows! 
SPOCK: Mister Boma, your tone is increasingly hostile. 
SPOCK: Curious. Most illogical. 
SPOCK: Strange. Step by step, I have made the correct and logical decisions. And yet two men have died. 
SPOCK: I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them, and inculcated resentment on your parts. The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole. 
SPOCK: How much longer, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, how much power do we have left in the ship's batteries? 
SPOCK: Will they electrify the exterior of this ship? 
SPOCK: Get to the centre of the ship. Don't touch the plates. Be sure you're insulated. Stand by. Are you ready, Scott? 
SPOCK: All right. Go. (Scott uses a spanner or something to short out the battery connections) Again! Again! 
SPOCK: I believe we've used enough. Mister Scott. I suggest you continue draining the phasers. 
SPOCK: For the moment. 
SPOCK: The moment they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be back. Meanwhile, please check the aft compartment. See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship. 
SPOCK: It will of course have to be left behind. 
SPOCK: I wouldn't recommend it. The creatures won't be far away. 
SPOCK: It would expose members of this crew to unnecessary peril. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen. All right, Mister Boma, you'll have your burial, provided the creatures will permit it. 
SPOCK: How about weight? 
SPOCK: And how long can we hold it? 
SPOCK: To land here again? Not a very attractive possibility. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy. Mister Boma. When can we lift off, Scott? 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly ten minutes. You have that long to bury Mister Gaetano. Now, it appears to be clear outside, at least for the moment. I'll assist you. Hurry. 
SPOCK: Get into the ship! Immediate lift off! 
SPOCK: No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No! 
SPOCK: All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go! 
SPOCK: Go, Scott! 
SPOCK: I told you to lift off! 
SPOCK: Get us off, Scott! 
SPOCK: Quite right, Mister Scott. There's somebody holding us down. All systems are go, but we're not moving. 
SPOCK: Our boosters. 
SPOCK: Would you rather stay here? 
SPOCK: May I remind you we have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we maintain it long. An hour from now we may be right back where we started from. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, by coming after me, you may well have destroyed what slim chance you had for survival. The logical thing for you to have done was to have left me behind. 
SPOCK: That is a most illogical attitude. Orbit in one minute, Mister Scott. Fuel status? 
SPOCK: It is the usual end of a decaying orbit. 
SPOCK: Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd be granted on the planet's surface, I should think. 
SPOCK: Did l? I may have been mistaken. 
SPOCK: The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus Three by now. I for one do not believe in angels. 
SPOCK: Yes. My first command. 
SPOCK: Galileo to Enterprise. Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please. Galileo to Enterprise. Come in, please. 
SPOCK: Perhaps, Mister Boma. 
SPOCK: No one out there to see it. 
SPOCK: Totally illogical. There was no chance. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Quite correct, Captain. 
SPOCK: Quite simply, Captain. I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless. Logic informed me that under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation. Logical decision, logically arrived at. 
SPOCK: Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts. 
SPOCK: No, sir. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, I believe I 
SPOCK: Miss Finney, come with me, please. 
SPOCK: I know all about them. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: Negative. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: But the computer is inaccurate, never the less. 
SPOCK: It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the Red Alert. 
SPOCK: And that is impossible. 
SPOCK: No, I was occupied. The ship was already on Yellow Alert. 
SPOCK: I do not dispute it. I merely state that it is wrong. 
SPOCK: I know the Captain. He is in 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian. Vulcanians do not speculate. I speak from pure logic. If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do. It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or malice. It is not his nature. 
SPOCK: Yes. In my opinion. 
SPOCK: Mister Finney is top of duty roster, Captain. 
SPOCK: Attention, Commander Finney, report to pod for reading on ion plates. 
SPOCK: Officer posted, Captain. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: I've run a complete megalyte survey on the computer. 
SPOCK: You sound bitter, Captain. 
SPOCK: Further instructions? 
SPOCK: Chess. 
SPOCK: Explain. 
SPOCK: That is true. 
SPOCK: Why, thank you, Doctor. I've just won my fourth game. 
SPOCK: Observe for yourself. Rook to king's pawn four. 
SPOCK: Now, this is the computer's move. And now mine. (takes the bishop) Checkmate. Mechanically, the computer's flawless. Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible. I could not accept that, however. 
SPOCK: Exactly. I programmed it myself for chess some months ago. The best I should have been able to attain was a draw. 
SPOCK: Transporter room, stand by. We're beaming down. 
SPOCK: Five in all. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago. I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own. The computer cannot make an error and assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times. Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and therefore the memory banks of that computer. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: The Captain, myself, and the records officer. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney. 
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. 
SPOCK: B deck, in or near Engineering. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged.&nbsp;
SPOCK: Compensate. 
SPOCK: Decaying, Captain. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, if you'll please hurry to the transporter room 
SPOCK: Very well, sir. 
SPOCK: Activate port impulse engines. One third power. 
SPOCK: Obviously. 
SPOCK: Eleven years, four months, five days.
SPOCK: Captain Pike, may I remain for a moment? (flash, the others leave) You know why I've come, Captain. It's only six days away at maximum warp and I have it well-planned. (flash, flash) I have never disobeyed your orders before, Captain, but this time I must. (flash, flash) I know. I know it is treachery and it's mutiny. but I must do this. (flash, flash) I have no choice. (flash, flash) 
SPOCK: I have security clearance, Chief.
SPOCK: This is Mister Spock. 
SPOCK [OC]: The ship's computers will handle the helm on this voyage, Mister Hansen. Course will be computed and set automatically. 
SPOCK: You will not discuss this with ship's crew or starbase personnel. Do you read? 
SPOCK: Stand by. We'll warp out of orbit in one hour. 
SPOCK: The Enterprise knows where she's going, Mister Hansen.
SPOCK: Maintain radio silence, Lieutenant. This is First Officer Spock. Per Starfleet orders this date, I have been placed in temporary command of the Enterprise. While our destination is secret, our mission is relatively simple. Starbase Command has assigned Captain Kirk medical rest leave until our return. His instructions are that you will obey my orders as you would his. First Officer out.
SPOCK: And no one from the ship made such a call.
SPOCK: Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you. Will you come with me, please. 
SPOCK: Doctor, one moment, please.
SPOCK: Take no action, Mister Hansen.
SPOCK: You have your orders, Mister Hansen. We'll make no contact. 
SPOCK: Lock on to sensors. Measure object now following the Enterprise.
SPOCK: Stop. How long before shuttlecraft's fuel supply forces return to starbase?
SPOCK: Computer control. Lock on to shuttlecraft following us.
SPOCK: Go to tape Abel Seven Baker. Execute instructions.
SPOCK: This is the First Officer speaking. Security, send an armed team to the Bridge. Transporter Room, stand by to beam Captain Kirk aboard. Effective until then, Lieutenant Hansen is in operational command.
SPOCK: First Officer out. Doctor, as senior officer present, I present myself to you for arrest.
SPOCK: The charge is mutiny, Doctor. I never received orders to take command.
SPOCK: Doctor.
SPOCK: Adequate, Doctor. I'll make no trouble.
SPOCK: Sir, I waive counsel. Further, I waive rights to this hearing and request immediate court-martial.
SPOCK: May I inquire on what grounds, Captain?
SPOCK: Sir, I must point out that there are three officers of command rank available. Yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher Pike.
SPOCK: I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.
SPOCK: I am.
SPOCK: Are your comments a part of the record, sir?
SPOCK: Thank you. Request monitor screen be engaged.
SPOCK: To comply with the request you just made, sir, that I explain the importance of going to Talos Four.
SPOCK: This is thirteen years ago. The Enterprise and its commander, Captain Christopher Pike.
SPOCK [on screen]: Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way.
SPOCK: I cannot tell you at this time, sir.
SPOCK: Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore. You did ask that question.
SPOCK: As I stated, gentlemen, this was thirteen years ago. We were on routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead. At first we were not certain what it was.
SPOCK: Their call letters check with a survey expedition. S.S. Columbia disappeared in that region approximately eighteen years ago.
SPOCK: Records show the Talos group has never been explored. Solar system similar to Earth, eleven planets. Number four seems to be Class M, oxygen atmosphere.
SPOCK: We aren't going to go, to be certain?
SPOCK [on monitor]: Mister Spock here. We're intercepting a follow-up message, sir. There are crash survivors on Talos. 
SPOCK: Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record. Are we seeing the actual events of thirteen years ago? (flash) Yes, gentlemen. On that screen as it happened, the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos Four. If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control.
SPOCK: Preliminary lab survey ready, sir.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
SPOCK [on screen]: Spock here.
SPOCK [on screen]: There is no survivors' encampment, Number One. This is all some sort of trap. We've lost the Captain. Do you read?
SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.
SPOCK: The Commodore must be aware that Captain Kirk knew nothing of this.
SPOCK: Sir, I respectfully decline.
SPOCK: Captain, Jim, please don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the transmission.
SPOCK: Guilty.
SPOCK: Guilty.
SPOCK: Guilty.
SPOCK: Are coming from Talos Four, sir.
SPOCK: Captain, Jim, please. Don't stop me. Don't let him stop me. It's your career and Captain Pike's life. You must see the rest of the transmission. 
SPOCK: You have no choice, sir. I'm sorry. The Keeper has taken over control of our screen. Do you understand, sir? (flash) As you saw before, Captain Pike had been knocked unconscious and captured by the Talosians. 
SPOCK: The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, probably manufacture food and other needs down there. Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.
SPOCK: Exactly. An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.
SPOCK: If we start buzzing about down there, we're liable to find their mental power's so great they could reach out and swat this ship as though it were a fly.
SPOCK: A brilliant deduction by Captain Pike, gentlemen. Yes, he was still inside his cell, but knowing that couldn't help him.
SPOCK: And could make him live any place, any time, any situation they wished. He would see, taste, suffer with the same reality as you gentlemen sitting there.
SPOCK: Because they know that Captain Pike is fatigued. We can reconvene later.
SPOCK: They want him back alive, sir.
SPOCK: If you'll be patient, the answers to your questions
SPOCK: My answer to your question would be quite unbelievable, sir. I regret we'll have to wait and see it there. 
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by, Number One.
SPOCK [OC]: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
SPOCK [OC]: Our circuits are beginning to heat. We'll have to cease power.
SPOCK: Much more, Captain. 
SPOCK: If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialised inside solid rock.
SPOCK: The women! 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, a moment, please.
SPOCK: Signal you want them to wait. Captain, please. It's your life now, at least a chance for life.
SPOCK: No, Captain. there's more to it. Watch. (the screen remains blank)
SPOCK: Talos controls the vessel now, sir, as they did thirteen years ago. You've asked me why. You'll see the answer now. 
SPOCK: Mister Spock here.
SPOCK [OC]: All decks prepare for hyperdrive.
SPOCK: Ask you to face the death penalty, too? One of us was enough, Captain.
SPOCK: Thank you, sir, for both of us. (flash)
SPOCK: I see no reason to insult me, sir. I believe I've been completely logical about the whole affair.
SPOCK: They should be sending up a report momentarily, Captain. (Kirk stretches and groans) Something wrong?
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. After what this ship has been through in the last three months, there is not a crewman aboard who is not in need of rest. Myself excepted, of course.
SPOCK: Not necessary in my case, Captain. On my planet, to rest is to rest, to cease using energy. To me, it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.
SPOCK: Very well, Captain. Something I did come to discuss.
SPOCK: I picked this up from Doctor McCoy's log. We have a crewmember aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue. Reaction time down nine to twelve percent, associational reading norm minus three.
SPOCK: He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation. Now, He has that right, but we've found 
SPOCK: James Kirk. Enjoy yourself, Captain. It's an interesting planet. You'll find it quite pleasant. Very much like your Earth. 
SPOCK [OC]: Scouts have detected no animals, artefacts, or force fields of any kind. Only peace, sunshine, and good air. You'll have no problems.
SPOCK [OC]: Captain.
SPOCK: I'm getting strange readings from the planet surface, Captain. Some sort of power field down there. 
SPOCK [OC]: A highly sophisticated type of energy draining our power and increasing, beginning to affect our communications.
SPOCK: Could be coming from beneath the planet's surface. Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity. 
SPOCK: Any chance these could be hallucinations? 
SPOCK: That sounds like a painful reality. 
SPOCK [OC]: There must be some logical explanation. 
SPOCK: Your signal is very weak. Can you turn up your gain?
SPOCK: Captain, shall I beam down an armed party? 
SPOCK: Necessary, Captain. Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless to us now. As I told you before, there's an unusual power field down here. It's soaking up all the energy at the source. I calculated the rate of its growth, and reasoned that I just might be able to transport one more person.
SPOCK: This is not human skin tissue, Captain. It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs. Much finer, of course.
SPOCK: This is definitely a mechanical contrivance. It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.
SPOCK: I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings. The plants, the animals, the people. They're all being manufactured.
SPOCK: All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing. Just as pleasant or just as deadly.
SPOCK: At this point, Captain, my analysis may not sound very scientific. 
SPOCK: There is one slight possibility, very slim, but nevertheless. Captain, what were your thoughts just before you encountered the people you described? 
SPOCK: Captain, wait.
SPOCK: Did you enjoy it, Captain?
SPOCK: Which supports a theory I've been formulating. 
SPOCK: Yes. Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured and provided for us.
SPOCK: Yes. We must all control our thoughts. 
SPOCK: The force field we encountered is obviously underground, manufacturing these things. Passages lead to the surface. Just for example, when Rodriguez thought of a tiger 
SPOCK: Captain.
SPOCK: The term is amusement park.
SPOCK: An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things. 
SPOCK: I tend to agree.
SPOCK: (handing the girl over to Sulu) Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over. With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for.
SPOCK: Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen?
SPOCK: Most illogical.
SPOCK: Gravimetric readings, no significant change, zero space density. 
SPOCK: The precise meaning of the word desert is a waterless, barren wasteland. I fail to understand your romantic nostalgia for such a place. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor McCoy. Moving on schedule into quadrant nine oh four. Beta Six is eight days distant. 
SPOCK: Unusual, Captain. I'm now getting a sizable space-displacement reading. 
SPOCK: Inconceivable this body has gone unnoted on all our records. 
SPOCK: Emergency! Full reverse power! 
SPOCK: Function is normal. Continuous sensor sweeps. Lieutenant Uhura, have you checked all wave bands? 
SPOCK: The decision will be mine, Doctor. I have the responsibility for your safety. (to Sulu's replacement) Mister Jaeger, describe your geophysical findings for the surface below. 
SPOCK: Estimate survival time of two unprotected individuals down there. 
SPOCK: Greetings and felicitations. Hmm. Send this, Lieutenant. USS Enterprise to signaler on planet surface. Identify self. 
SPOCK: Hip hip hoorah? And I believe it's pronounced tally ho. 
SPOCK: I'll entertain any theories, Mister DeSalle. Any at all. 
SPOCK: You're quite correct, Doctor. Prepare transporter room. 
SPOCK: No, Mister Scott. Neither you nor I can be spared here. Mister DeSalle, equip the landing party with full communications, armament, and life-support gear. Mister Jaeger, your geophysical knowledge may be crucial down there. Doctor McCoy will accompany. If those peculiar signals are coming from Captain Kirk or Lieutenant Sulu, their rationality is in question. Dismissed. 
SPOCK: Very good. Transmit coordinates to Mister Scott. Once on the planet's surface, you'll establish contact with us immediately. Use the laser beacon if necessary. Ready, Scott? 
SPOCK: Activate. 
SPOCK: I don't, Mister Scott. It simply exists. Artificial perhaps, or a freak of nature. The fact remains that life can exist in that area. 
SPOCK: Apply a fine tuning on our sensors. Locate any life forms in that stable area. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. But if the Captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be. We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect. 
SPOCK: Or stand by and do nothing, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: They didn't, Captain. Not clearly. We merely beamed up all life forms in a given area. 
SPOCK: I am Spock. 
SPOCK: My father is from the planet Vulcan. 
SPOCK: Not generally. But there have been exceptions. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: I object to you. I object to intellect without discipline. I object to power without constructive purpose. 
SPOCK: It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical. 
SPOCK: Fascinating is a word I use for the unexpected. In this case, I should think interesting would suffice. 
SPOCK: That his food has no taste, his wine no flavour? No. It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms, but none of the substance. 
SPOCK: Evidently. 
SPOCK: Is it ego, or something else? 
SPOCK: The mirror. 
SPOCK: You noted yourself he never gets very far from it. I suppose it could be vanity. 
SPOCK: A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves. It would have a very complex memory bank, and would be extremely sophisticated. 
SPOCK: I think not. A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense. 
SPOCK: Free, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: The machine. 
SPOCK: Can we know his range is, Captain? 
SPOCK: Collision course. 
SPOCK: That was the planet Gothos, Captain. 
SPOCK: Gothos again, Captain. 
SPOCK: Cat and mouse game. 
SPOCK: Or it toward us. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, we're receiving you. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: For the record, how do we describe him? Pure mentality? Force of intellect? Embodied energy? Superbeing? He must be classified, sir. 
SPOCK: I hardly find that fitting. 
SPOCK: It will make a strange entry in the library banks. 
SPOCK: Mischievous pranks, Captain? 
SPOCK: I shall be delighted, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain. I wonder why he's insistent that our tactical aides come down.
SPOCK: Perhaps, Captain, but nevertheless 
SPOCK: Doctor, you are a sensualist.
SPOCK: Those messages we got, Captain, the one directing us here yesterday. 
SPOCK: Captain, impulses that direction. Very weak, possibly a survivor.
SPOCK: Getting another life reading, Captain.
SPOCK: Not survivors. Not warm-blooded. Living creatures, but not human.
SPOCK: Azimuth ninety three degrees, range one five seven zero yards.
SPOCK: We're hopelessly outnumbered here, Captain. It's those disruptors versus our hand phasers. 
SPOCK: Sulu is an experienced combat officer.
SPOCK: Nor can they at us at the moment. Not unless they moved their original position. That intervening high ground. 
SPOCK: About one hundred yards in that direction. But after an attack as thorough as this one
SPOCK: How is he, Doctor? 
SPOCK: They're moving. I've got to get to the Captain. 
SPOCK: Locked on to the enemy, Captain. They're moving toward the high ground. (fizzing sound and smoke) They've locked on to my tricorder. 
SPOCK: Very ingenious. They fed back my own impulses and built up an overload.
SPOCK: Any word from the Enterprise?
SPOCK: Very clever. As to the reason? 
SPOCK: You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof 
SPOCK: Not necessarily, sir. Several possible explanations 
SPOCK: Very well, then. If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.
SPOCK: Virtually nothing, Captain. No records of any explorations. There are rumours of certain strange signals on subspace channels. However, none has ever been recorded.
SPOCK: Nothing specific, Captain. Unscientific rumours only. More like space legends.
SPOCK: A sustained warp seven speed will be dangerous, Captain.
SPOCK: You mean to destroy the alien ship, Captain? 
SPOCK: I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient. Destruction might be unnecessary.
SPOCK: The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony, Jim.
SPOCK: I merely suggested that a regard for sentient life 
SPOCK: Very clear, Captain.
SPOCK: It would appear someone is curious about us.
SPOCK: Computer lock ready, Captain. All systems standing by.
SPOCK: Same as the alien, Captain.
SPOCK: All systems report normal, Captain. No ascertainable damage.
SPOCK: We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar system.
SPOCK: We are being held.
SPOCK: No, sir. An unidentifiable power. 
SPOCK: Have you tried overload?
SPOCK: How about bypassing the transformer banks? Feed the impulse engines directly. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature of the force which holds us here?
SPOCK: No indication of its composition? Gravimetric? Magnetic? Electronic? 
SPOCK: Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in case.
SPOCK: I'm going to wait, Doctor. There's little else I can do.
SPOCK: If I could help him, I would. I cannot.
SPOCK: He's out there, Doctor. Out there somewhere in a thousand cubic parsecs of space, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him. 
SPOCK: This is the U.S.S. Enterprise calling the Metrons. Our channels are open. Come in, please. We urgently desire a conference. Please answer. 
SPOCK: But it has happened, Doctor.
SPOCK: Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were. Notice the substance encrusting that rock. Yes. Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate. 
SPOCK: Perhaps nothing, Doctor. (Kirk tastes the mineral and spits it out) Perhaps everything. 
SPOCK: It may well be possible, Doctor. We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
SPOCK: Perhaps. That is something best decided by diplomats.
SPOCK: Yes. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Good. Good. (Kirk cuts vines to length against a rock) He knows, Doctor. He has reasoned it out.
SPOCK: Yes. Yes.
SPOCK; An invention, Doctor. First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulphur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal. 
SPOCK; Diamonds. The hardest known substance. Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles.
SPOCK: Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor. Gunpowder. 
SPOCK; Coal. 
SPOCK: If he has the time, Doctor. If he has the time.
SPOCK: After you touched off your primitive cannon, Captain, we lost the picture the Metron was sending us.
SPOCK: Most of it. I would be interested in knowing what finally happened.
SPOCK: I've frequently had my doubts.
SPOCK: A thousand years, Captain?
SPOCK: Your move, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'll have you checkmated your next move. 
SPOCK: Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions. 
SPOCK: The fact one of my ancestors married a human female 
SPOCK: Not large enough even for a lifeboat. 
SPOCK: More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt, pitted. 
SPOCK: He played most illogically. His next move should have been the rook. 
SPOCK: The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks. 
SPOCK: Getting something from the recorder now. 
SPOCK: Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction. 
SPOCK: Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings. 
SPOCK: Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it. No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship. 
SPOCK: Force field of some kind. 
SPOCK: Sensor beam on. 
SPOCK: Deflectors full intensity. 
SPOCK: Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't. Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative. 
SPOCK: Negative! 
SPOCK: Damage control reports, all stations! 
SPOCK: Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells. Casualties, nine dead. 
SPOCK: I think we've found that answer, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically searching for ESP information on his crew. 
SPOCK: Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously? 
SPOCK: Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power. 
SPOCK: He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? 
SPOCK: Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into. 
SPOCK: Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? 
SPOCK: And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement. 
SPOCK: In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him, but actually an annoyance. 
SPOCK: We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice. 
SPOCK: Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines. 
SPOCK: It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship. 
SPOCK: Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still can. 
SPOCK: It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time. 
SPOCK: The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that. 
SPOCK: He's regaining consciousness. 
SPOCK: Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now. 
SPOCK: He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed back faster. He didn't become as weak. 
SPOCK: Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time. 
SPOCK: If he should try to stop us 
SPOCK: I felt for him, too. 
SPOCK: Very typical, Captain. Iron-silicon base, oxygen-hydrogen atmosphere, largely arid, no discernible life. No surprises. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Incredible, Captain. 
SPOCK: What my instruments read is totally unbelievable, Captain. Twice, for a split second each time, everything within range of our instruments seemed on the verge of winking out. 
SPOCK: I have given you the facts, Captain. The entire magnetic field in this solar system simply blinked. The planet below, the mass of which we're measuring, attained zero gravity. 
SPOCK: Is non-existence. 
SPOCK: Captain, scanners now report a life object on the planet surface below. 
SPOCK: Inexplicable, Captain. This reading began at approximately the moment that the pulsation phenomenon began to subside. 
SPOCK: A living being. Body temperature 98.5 Fahrenheit. Mass, electrical impulses, movement. It is apparently human, Captain. 
SPOCK; Almost to the second. 
SPOCK: None. 
SPOCK: Possible. Very possible. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Scanners indicate situation normal. 
SPOCK: Nothing. Illogical. An effect of such proportions, unexplainable by any established physical laws that I'm aware of. I have been able to ascertain one fact. Though the effect, whatever it was, was unquestioningly widespread, it was strongest here on the planet beneath us. 
SPOCK: Third, a closer examination of the planet's surface would be in order. My job, sir? 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Anything from our guest? 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information. I ordered re-confirmation on our sensors. They indicate no living creature on this planet. I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to. 
SPOCK: I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir. I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar. 
SPOCK: I'm trying, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centred here on this planet, almost on this very spot. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. I can no more explain the occurrence of the second phenomenon than I can the first. 
SPOCK: That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude? 
SPOCK: Indeed. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: Captain, I only know for certain that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations. 
SPOCK [OC]: Request you come to the Bridge, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Something quite extraordinary. 
SPOCK: Main screen on, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Source of radiation, Captain. 
SPOCK: Because it is not there. 
SPOCK: What I mean, Captain, is that according to our usual scanning procedures, there is nothing there that could be causing that effect. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words. It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as a rip in our universe. 
SPOCK: A kind of physical warp, Captain, in which none of our established physical laws apply with any regularity. However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localise it. 
SPOCK: You refer to the humanoid? 
SPOCK: Why does he need the crystals? For what reason? 
SPOCK: Unable to locate the source of radiation. 
SPOCK: It has simply disappeared, Captain. 
SPOCK: True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are specifically designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter. 
SPOCK: Correct. Which would seem to be impossible. 
SPOCK: Perfect working condition. 
SPOCK: Nor in our universe, Captain. It came from outside. 
SPOCK: The possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unquestionably a warp. A distortion of physical laws on an immense scale. 
SPOCK: Indeed. I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape 
SPOCK: There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion. 
SPOCK: Difficult, Captain. One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational. Almost as if he were two men. 
SPOCK: Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass. 
SPOCK: The cut on his forehead. First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again. 
SPOCK: Quite right. Unquestionably, there are two of him. 
SPOCK: Jim, madness has no purpose or reason, but it may have a goal. He must be stopped, held. Destroyed if necessary. 
SPOCK: Two parallel universes project this. One positive, the other negative. Or, more specifically, one matter, the other antimatter. 
SPOCK: Precisely. Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet 
SPOCK: Annihilation, Jim. Total, complete, absolute annihilation. 
SPOCK: Lazarus. A trick to get the crystals. 
SPOCK: Spock to Bridge. 
SPOCK: Lazarus. 
SPOCK: Take these crystals to the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: What of Lazarus? 
SPOCK: There is, of course, no escape for them, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, the universe is safe. 
SPOCK: Except for secondary systems, everything is out, sir. We're on impulse power only. 
SPOCK: If Mister Scott is still with us, auxiliaries should be on momentarily. (Uhura is just stirring on the floor) Are you all right, Lieutenant? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott is still with us. 
SPOCK: Captain? Casualty reports indicate only minor injuries. Engineering reports warp engines non-operational. Mister Scott overrode the automatic helm setting and is holding us in orbit on impulse power. 
SPOCK: Earth, Captain. We were on a general course in this direction when we were pulled in by the star. Apparently the breakaway threw us on in the same direction. 
SPOCK: We are too low in the atmosphere to retain this orbit, Captain. Engineering reports we have sufficient impulse power to achieve escape velocity. 
SPOCK: Apparently, Captain, so are we. 
SPOCK: Whiplash propelled us into a time warp, Captain. Backward. Exact chronometer readings in a few moments. 
SPOCK: Verified. Scanners report some type of craft approaching from below us. Under cloud cover and closing. 
SPOCK: Positive identification, Captain. Aircraft is an interceptor, equipped with missiles, possibly armed with nuclear warheads. If he hits us with one, he might damage us severely, perhaps beyond our capacity to repair under current circumstances. 
SPOCK: Captain, this type of aircraft might be too fragile to take our tractor beam. 
SPOCK: Aircraft is breaking up, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK [OC]: The aircraft has completely broken up, Captain. Shall we turn off the tractor beam? 
SPOCK: Neither have I. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: We've achieved a stable orbit out of Earth's atmosphere. Our deflectors are operative, enough to prevent our being picked up again as a UFO. And Mister Scott wishes to speak to you about the engines. 
SPOCK: Captain Christopher. 
SPOCK: We cannot return him to Earth, Captain. He already knows too much about us and is learning more. I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations. and in so doing, change what must be. And if it is changed, Captain, you and I and all that we know might not even exist. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: I have investigated it, Captain. To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a Starbase. 
SPOCK: It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle. 
SPOCK: We put in at Cygnet Fourteen for general repair and maintenance. Cygnet Fourteen is a planet dominated by women. They seemed to feel the ship's computer system lacked a personality. They gave it one. Female, of course. 
SPOCK: I have run a computer check on all historical tapes. They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK [OC]: Have some new information regarding Captain Christopher. Important I see you both immediately. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, sir. Bridge out. 
SPOCK: Crude methods, but effective. 
SPOCK: I made an error in my computations. 
SPOCK: I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all. 
SPOCK: Poor choice of words on my part. I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring. I find, after running a crosscheck on that factor, that your son Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant 
SPOCK: The doctor is correct. Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Shaun Geoffrey Christopher to go to Saturn. 
SPOCK: Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return. We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it. It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska. 
SPOCK: And Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter. 
SPOCK: Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane. It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine UFO. Possibly alien, definitely destructive. 
SPOCK: A theory. A reverse application of what happened to us. Logically, it could work. Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now. 
SPOCK: Not at all. You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a UFO. 
SPOCK: Fifteen minutes, twenty eight seconds. 
SPOCK: It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach. In our case 
SPOCK: I am. 
SPOCK: You may be correct, Doctor. Open communicator channel. 
SPOCK: Beam up immediately. 
SPOCK: We'll know in a moment, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Spock here. Are you all right, Captain? 
SPOCK: I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain. 
SPOCK: Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is. 
SPOCK: Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Do so now, engineer. We'll need all power to test our theory. 
SPOCK: (examining a roll of film) Poor photography. 
SPOCK: I am aware of that, Doctor. This is the first officer. Captain Christopher to the briefing room. 
SPOCK: Quite logical, Captain. Can you give us the co-ordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? 
SPOCK: I can't do that, Captain. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me. The captain will provide the co-ordinates for the transporter chief. 
SPOCK: One for you, one for me. Set them on heavy stun force. 
SPOCK: In fact, I do. But only to a certain point. 
SPOCK: Energise. 
SPOCK: Don't you find that painful, Captain? 
SPOCK: He knew the exact beam down co-ordinates for this section of the base. It was necessary to bring him along. 
SPOCK: I suspected he might not wish to return with us. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, like the one that put us here. My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp. 
SPOCK: Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time. We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky. Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened. 
SPOCK: Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly. From here, we'll move even faster. And Captain, notice the chronometers. They've started backward. Minute by minute, the speed of time passage will now increase. 
SPOCK: Approaching breakaway point. On the countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
SPOCK: We've broken free and heading back. 
SPOCK: Chronometers moving forward again, Captain. 
SPOCK: Computed. 
SPOCK: Twenty minutes, sir. It'll be close. 
SPOCK: Ten minutes. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. 
SPOCK: Approaching second beaming, Captain. 
SPOCK: Now. 
SPOCK: Approaching our century, Captain. Braking should begin now. 
SPOCK: Fifty years to go. 
SPOCK: Forty, thirty. 
SPOCK: Odd. The expression on that man's face. The mindlessness. Vacant contentment. 
SPOCK: Evidently they're not prepared to deal with out right disobedience. How did you know? 
SPOCK: Your analysis seems logical. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. This is merely a hollow tube, Captain. No mechanism. 
SPOCK: Totally illogical. Yesterday, without apparent cause or reason, they wrought total havoc. Yet today, now 
SPOCK: Telepathy, Captain. 
SPOCK: Amazing in this culture. 
SPOCK: It took a very advanced technology to construct a device like this. Inconsistent with this environment 
SPOCK: Strong power generations, Captain. Near here, but radiating in all directions. 
SPOCK: An underground? How are you organised? 
SPOCK: Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Sensor beams, very strong. We're being probed. In this direction. 
SPOCK: Block them out. 
SPOCK: Too strong, Captain. Can't be blocked. 
SPOCK: Projection, Captain. Unreal. 
SPOCK: He doesn't hear you, Captain. 
SPOCK: Where's Doctor McCoy? 
SPOCK: I should say they've been here and been removed. 
SPOCK: Evidently a maximum security establishment. Are you armed? 
SPOCK: The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic. 
SPOCK: Sound waves. Stronger, they might have killed us. As it was, they merely rendered us unconscious. 
SPOCK: We shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain. In a society as well organised as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected. Interesting, however. Their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data. 
SPOCK: Quite human, Captain. It's simply that all the facts are not yet in. There are gaps. 
SPOCK: Like Sulu. 
SPOCK: You've been corrected, Captain. You'd better go. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, what will happen to him? 
SPOCK: Impossible. He's under extremely powerful control. 
SPOCK: Little else we can do, unless you can think of a way to get through that door. 
SPOCK: And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension. Not simple, not ridiculous. Very, very dangerous. 
SPOCK: What about the Captain? 
SPOCK: We are not Archons, Marplon. 
SPOCK: Where is Reger? 
SPOCK: Who is Landru? 
SPOCK: Joy be with you. Peace and contentment. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Quite all right. Be careful of Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK: I am formulating a theory, Captain. 
SPOCK: Not here. The doctor. 
SPOCK: This is a soulless society, Captain. It has no spirit, no spark. All is indeed peace and tranquillity. The peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine. All parts working in unison. 
SPOCK: Until new orders are received. The question is, who gives those orders? 
SPOCK: There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense. 
SPOCK: Sir? 
SPOCK: Captain, our Prime Directive of non-interference. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. status report. 
SPOCK: Report, Scott. 
SPOCK: Captain. (gives him a phaser) 
SPOCK: Useless, Captain. A projection. 
SPOCK: A machine. This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection. Peace, harmony. 
SPOCK: The good of the Body, Captain. That's the key. 
SPOCK: Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it? 
SPOCK: Not necessary, Captain. They have no guidance. Possibly for the first time in their lives. 
SPOCK: Then the body dies. Creativity is necessary for the health of the Body. 
SPOCK: What's left of him, after he built and programmed this machine six thousand years ago. 
SPOCK: Marvellous. 
SPOCK: The late Landru, Captain. A marvellous feat of engineering. A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings. 
SPOCK: Predictably metaphysical. I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable. 
SPOCK: That is very kind of you, Captain. 
SPOCK: How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure as the one Landru provided. 
SPOCK: In view of code seven-ten, Captain, may I suggest 
SPOCK: We know very little about them. Their civilisation is advanced. They've had space flight for several centuries, but they've never ventured beyond their own solar system. When first contacted more than fifty years ago, Eminiar Seven was at war with its nearest neighbour. 
SPOCK: The Earth expedition making the report failed to return from its mission. The USS Valiant. Listed as missing in space. 
SPOCK: Transporter room standing by, Captain. 
SPOCK: We've selected a site which from the traffic seems to be near an official establishment. 
SPOCK: No hostility directed toward us. No apparent notice taken of us at all, which seems strange. They did scan us when we assumed orbit. Obviously, they know we're here. 
SPOCK: Screens down, but all defensive details on general alert status, Captain. 
SPOCK: Sir, we have completely scanned your planet. We find it highly advanced, prosperous in a material sense, comfortable for your people, and peaceful in the extreme. Yet you say you are at war. There is no evidence of this. 
SPOCK: With whom are you at war? 
SPOCK: Strange. 
SPOCK: Are these attacks frequent? 
SPOCK: None, Captain. Yeoman Tamula. 
SPOCK: Tricorder readings. Radiation. Disturbances of any kind. 
SPOCK: Computers, Captain. They fight their war with computers. Totally. 
SPOCK: Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical. 
SPOCK: There is a certain scientific logic about it. 
SPOCK: I do not approve. I understand. 
SPOCK: Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians, Captain. It may work. It may not. 
SPOCK: My pleasure, Captain. 
SPOCK: I understand. 
SPOCK: An entrance, Captain, but no exit. They go in, but they do not come out. 
SPOCK: So I would assume. 
SPOCK: Sir, there's a multi-legged creature crawling on your shoulder. 
SPOCK: We captured four of their disrupter-type weapons, two complete outfits of male clothing, and perhaps most important of all, one of their communication devices. 
SPOCK: Not at this time. Its range is restricted in comparison with ours. I may be able to alter its components, but it will take time. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise, come in. 
SPOCK: Is the ship all right? 
SPOCK: The Captain is overdue. We've suffered no casualties among us. This is important. Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from the Enterprise. They'd be killed the moment they arrived. 
SPOCK: The Ambassador? 
SPOCK: Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders. Spock out. 
SPOCK: Find the Ambassador and the Captain. Yeoman Tamula, you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself. Knock her down if necessary. This is a killing situation. Do what you must to protect yourself. Clear? 
SPOCK: Please, Mister Fox. Ladies and gentlemen, please move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured. 
SPOCK: Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir. 
SPOCK: I'll take you to a place of comparative safety, then I must find the Captain. 
SPOCK: By now, Mister Ambassador, I'm sure you realise that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here. 
SPOCK: Very well, sir. We need all the help we can get. 
SPOCK: I had assumed you needed help. I see I'm in error. 
SPOCK: These are the attack computers, Captain. That one's defence, that one computes the casualties. They're all tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts. 
SPOCK: At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties. 
SPOCK: This one's the key. The circuit is now locked. Destroy this one, and they'll all go. 
SPOCK: There's a chance it may work, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, you took a big chance. 
SPOCK: A feeling is not much to go on. 
SPOCK: Captain, you almost make me believe in luck. 
SPOCK: Definitely a space vessel of some type. 
SPOCK: Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights into this sector for years. 
SPOCK: I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. 
SPOCK: Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. 
SPOCK: Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens. 
SPOCK: Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. 
SPOCK: Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name. SS Botany Bay. 
SPOCK: No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War. 
SPOCK: Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant McGivers. 
SPOCK [OC]: Attention. The following personnel report to transporter room. Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge. 
SPOCK: A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip? 
SPOCK: If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. 
SPOCK: Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. 
SPOCK: Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none. 
SPOCK: Irritation? 
SPOCK: I am not capable of that emotion. 
SPOCK: Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain. 
SPOCK: Aye, sir. 
SPOCK: I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. 
SPOCK: There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations. 
SPOCK: Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition. 
SPOCK: I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated. 
SPOCK: Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty Napoleons might still be alive? 
SPOCK: And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. 
SPOCK: There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. 
SPOCK: Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? 
SPOCK: Under dozens of petty dictatorships. 
SPOCK: Then your sympathies were with 
SPOCK: From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world. From Asia through the Middle East. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is 
SPOCK: And as little freedom. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen. 
SPOCK: Illogical. 
SPOCK: Turbo elevators inoperative. Jammed, Captain. 
SPOCK: Useless. They're on override in Engineering. 
SPOCK: Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals. 
SPOCK: Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated. 
SPOCK: Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased. 
SPOCK: Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room. His men have control of the ship. 
SPOCK: There's a relay junction down the corridor. 
SPOCK [OC]: Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering. Someone just closed that line. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, acknowledge. Unable to flood Engineering section. I suspect 
SPOCK [OC]: Negative. We must retake the vessel while the anesthesia lasts. Meet me in the Armoury. I'm blowing it clear first. Spock out. 
SPOCK: Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable. 
SPOCK: It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today. 
SPOCK: Absolutely none, Captain. Berthold rays are such a recent discovery. We do not yet have full knowledge of their nature. It is known, however, that living animal tissue disintegrates under exposure. Sandoval's group could not have survived after three years. 
SPOCK: I am saying they knew there was a risk. 
SPOCK: The breakdown of tissue does not develop immediately. We can risk a limited exposure. 
SPOCK: Captain, this planet is being bombarded by Berthold rays, as our reports indicated. At this intensity, we'll be safe for a week if necessary. But 
SPOCK: There's also no question of the fact that Berthold rays are incontrovertibly deadly. There's no miracle connected with it, Doctor, you know that. No cures, no serums, no antidotes. If a man is exposed long enough, he dies. 
SPOCK: Spock here, Captain. There seems to be a total absence of life on the planet, with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora. 
SPOCK: Not at the moment, sir. I am conducting various tests with the tricorder, but results are inconclusive. 
SPOCK: Nothing. Not even insects. Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to Berthold rays. 
SPOCK: Please do. 
SPOCK: I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question. 
SPOCK: I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here. 
SPOCK: Logically, you should all be dead. 
SPOCK: Emotions are alien to me. I'm a scientist. 
SPOCK: You've not yet explained the nature of this thing. 
SPOCK: What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill. And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible. 
SPOCK: Spores? 
SPOCK: No. 
SPOCK: No, I can't. Please, don't! 
SPOCK: I am not like you. 
SPOCK: I love you. I can love you. 
SPOCK: That one looks like a dragon. You see the tail and the dorsal spines? 
SPOCK: I have. On Berengaria Seven. But I've never stopped to look at clouds before. Or rainbows. You know, I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question. 
SPOCK: Yes, what did you want? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. What did you want? 
SPOCK: I don't believe I want to tell you. 
SPOCK: No, I don't think so. 
SPOCK: I don't think so, sir. 
SPOCK: I didn't want to, Jim. 
SPOCK: There'll be no evacuation, Jim, but perhaps we should go back and get you straightened out. 
SPOCK: Very well. Come with me. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu understands, don't you, Mister Sulu? 
SPOCK: I can see the Captain is going to be difficult. 
SPOCK: Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down. 
SPOCK: He went off to create something called a mint julep. That's a drink, Jim. 
SPOCK: It's impossible to say. They drifted through space until they finally landed here. You see, they actually thrive on Berthold rays. The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit. 
SPOCK: It's a true Eden, Jim. There's belonging and love. 
SPOCK: You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later. Join us. Please. 
SPOCK: Yes, Jim. What is it now? 
SPOCK: Wonderful, Jim. When will you beam down? 
SPOCK: Good. Leila and I will meet you at the beam down point. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: What's keeping you, Jim? We've been waiting. 
SPOCK: Do you want me to beam up a party? 
SPOCK: Just a moment. It won't take long. Do you mind? 
SPOCK: Ready to beam up, Jim. 
SPOCK: The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerised is inaccurate. A machine can be computerised, not a man. 
SPOCK: Jim, I don't understand. 
SPOCK: Captain, if you'll excuse me. 
SPOCK: My mother was a teacher. My father an ambassador. 
SPOCK: Captain, please don't 
SPOCK: That's enough. 
SPOCK: You did that to me deliberately. 
SPOCK: The spores. They're gone. I don't belong anymore. 
SPOCK: That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over five hundred crewmen and colonists is hardly logical. 
SPOCK: It can be done. 
SPOCK: Captain. Striking a fellow officer is a court martial offence. 
SPOCK: That is quite logical, Captain. 
SPOCK: Enterprise. Spock here. 
SPOCK: Yes. Yes. I'm quite well. 
SPOCK: Are you still at the beam down point, and is the doctor there? 
SPOCK: Give your communicator back to Doctor McCoy. You won't need it to beam up. It'll take a few moments. Just wait there. Out. 
SPOCK: I'll be back shortly, Captain. 
SPOCK: It was necessary. 
SPOCK: I can't. 
SPOCK: I have a responsibility to this ship, to that man on the Bridge. I am what I am, Leila, and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them. Mine can be no worse than someone else's. 
SPOCK: (wiping away her tears) You couldn't pronounce it. 
SPOCK: They'll not hear this, of course. It'll be more a sensation of feeling it. 
SPOCK: Precisely. It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes. 
SPOCK: Enterprise. Spock here. 
SPOCK: Just a moment. They're all beginning to call in, Captain. Rather contritely, I should say. Sandoval wishes to speak to you. 
SPOCK: Poetry, Captain. Non-regulation. 
SPOCK: I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy. 
SPOCK: I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been discovered. 
SPOCK: There is no current volcanic activity on this planet, Captain. 
SPOCK: Oh. You mean shot at it. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: (examining a large globe from Vanderberg's desk) Mister Vanderberg, what is this? 
SPOCK: But a geological oddity, to say the least. Pure silicon? 
SPOCK: (at the mine map) I've charted the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage. Here, here, and here. If the times of these incidents are to be accepted as accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible rate of speed. 
SPOCK: If we could force another appearance of this creature 
SPOCK: I wouldn't touch it, Captain. An extremely active corrosive. Traces may linger. 
SPOCK: The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive. 
SPOCK: Nothing for a device this antiquated, Captain. 
SPOCK: The missing pump wasn't taken by accident. It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor. 
SPOCK: It would seem so. 
SPOCK: I don't know. But there is a possibility. 
SPOCK: Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds, but what if life exists based on another element? For instance, silicon. 
SPOCK: Certainly not phaser one, which is far less powerful than phaser two. 
SPOCK: It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser one. 
SPOCK: Which I could adjust to be more effective against silicon. 
SPOCK: It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level, the level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature. 
SPOCK: I don't know. 
SPOCK: I have already given Doctor McCoy sufficient cause for amusement. I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, the security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office. 
SPOCK: Mister Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? 
SPOCK: Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon, Captain. Interesting. 
SPOCK: A life form, Captain. Bearing one hundred eleven degrees, elevation four degrees. 
SPOCK: No, sir. Silicon. 
SPOCK: He never even had a chance to fire, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: This tunnel. My readings indicate it was made within the hour. Moments ago, in fact. 
SPOCK: Positive. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. I'm quite at a loss. 
SPOCK: Disappeared. Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly. 
SPOCK: Indeed. This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes. 
SPOCK: Readings indicate a maze of tunnels of this general category in that direction. 
SPOCK: The closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos. A mineral, Captain. 
SPOCK: It would seem so. Silicon-based. 
SPOCK: We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air. 
SPOCK: Correct. This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive. 
SPOCK: And it explains the murdered men. 
SPOCK: Or a single phaser with much longer contact. 
SPOCK: I've run a complete spherical check on all life forms, radius one hundred miles. I've located our men, all of them, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing two hundred and one. And that is all. 
SPOCK: Exactly. Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime. 
SPOCK: Or it is the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels. If so, if it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science. 
SPOCK: I see no alternative myself, Captain. It merely seems a pity. The search team is gathering in the main tunnel. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts, please. I last located the creature in the area marked adit26 moving in bearing two zero one. This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions in an effort to surround it, and possibly capture it. 
SPOCK: You did not, sir. I merely thought that if the opportunity arose 
SPOCK: Very well, sir. 
SPOCK: II beg your pardon, sir? 
SPOCK: Is not needed there, sir. Mister Scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than I do. You're aware of that. 
SPOCK: Captain, there are approximately one hundred of us engaged in this search, against one creature. The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.7 to 1. 
SPOCK: And they are of course accurate, Captain. 
SPOCK: That is always my intention, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are being watched. 
SPOCK: No, sir. We're being watched. 
SPOCK: Captain. Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels. 
SPOCK: Should we separate? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain. 
SPOCK: Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them. 
SPOCK [OC]: Only a theory I have. 
SPOCK: Captain? Are you all right? Jim? Jim! 
SPOCK: I could phaser you out. 
SPOCK: Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse. Please proceed with extreme caution. I shall quicken my pace. 
SPOCK: Captain, I just read some fresh signs. 
SPOCK [OC]: The creature is in this area. I'll take a lifeform reading. 
SPOCK: Where, Captain? 
SPOCK: Kill it, Captain, quickly. 
SPOCK: You don't dare take the chance, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Kill it. 
SPOCK: Jim, your life is in danger. You can't take the risk. 
SPOCK: I remind you it's a proven killer. I'm on my way. Spock out. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. It's made no moves against you? 
SPOCK: Yes, I see. 
SPOCK: Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain. Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds. 
SPOCK: It's possible. 
SPOCK: I'll try. 
SPOCK: Pain! Pain! Pain! (he staggers back) That's all I got, Captain. Waves and waves of searing pain. It's in agony. 
SPOCK: I don't know, Captain. Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me. In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal. In great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature. It calls itself a Horta. 
SPOCK: Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet. 
SPOCK: Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life. Doctor McCoy's medical knowledge will be totally useless. 
SPOCK: To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it. 
SPOCK: Murder. Of thousands. Devils! Eternity ends. The chamber of the ages. The altar of tomorrow! Murderers! Stop them. Kill! Strike back! Monsters! 
SPOCK: The end of life. Murderers. 
SPOCK: Understood. It is the end of life. Eternity stops. Go out into the tunnel. To the chamber of the ages. Cry for the children. Walk carefully in the vault of tomorrow. Sorrow for the murdered children. The thing you search for is there. Go. Go. Sadness. Sadness for the end of things. Go into the tunnel. There is a passageway. Quickly, quickly. 
SPOCK: (channeling the Horta) It is time to sleep. It is over. Failure. The murderers have won. Death is welcome. Let it end here. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch. 
SPOCK: There have been many generations of Horta on this planet. Every fifty thousand years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live. She cares for them, protects them. And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them. This creature here is the mother of her race. 
SPOCK: And they are the most inoffensive of creatures. They harbour ill will towards no one. 
SPOCK: Except for one thing. The Horta is badly wounded. It may die. 
SPOCK: It seems logical, Captain. The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans, I find that curiously refreshing. 
SPOCK: Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain. Course laid in. 
SPOCK: Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel one. 
SPOCK: Curious. What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me. She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it. 
SPOCK: Not specifically, but I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all. I didn't have the heart to tell her that only I have 
SPOCK: Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature, with impeccable taste. 
SPOCK: Really, Captain, my modesty 
SPOCK: Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted. 
SPOCK: Captain, we've reached the designated position for scanning the coded directive tape. 
SPOCK: Strategically sound. Organia is the only Class M planet in the disputed area, ideally located for use by either side. 
SPOCK: Inhabited by humanoids. A very peaceful, friendly people living on a primitive level. Little of intrinsic value. Approximately Class D minus on Richter's scale of cultures. 
SPOCK: Sir? 
SPOCK: We've hit him, Captain. He's hurt. 
SPOCK: Minor, Captain. We were most fortunate. Blast damage in decks ten and eleven, minor buckling in the antimatter pods, casualties very light. 
SPOCK: Yes. It would seem to be an unfriendly act. 
SPOCK: Curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want. 
SPOCK: With the outbreak of hostilities, that might not be easy. 
SPOCK: Negotiating with the Organians will be time-consuming, Captain, and time is one thing we'll have the least of. 
SPOCK: Yes. Curious lack of interest. Notice the ruins in the distance, Captain. Quite large. 
SPOCK: Whatever it is, it would seem to be inconsistent with the reports we've been given on this culture. 
SPOCK: It would seem so. 
SPOCK: Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies. 
SPOCK: Captain, our information on these people and their culture was not correct. This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanisation. They are totally stagnant. There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register. 
SPOCK: Nevertheless, it is true. For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment. This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development. 
SPOCK: So it would seem. Not a very pleasant prospect. 
SPOCK: Captain, our phasers are gone. 
SPOCK: Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain. It is a practical approach. 
SPOCK: I am Spock, a dealer in kevas and trillium. 
SPOCK: Perfectly, Baroner. But it was an interesting experience. 
SPOCK: Not necessary, Commander. I understand you very well. 
SPOCK: It should not be underestimated, Captain. It reaches directly into the mind. We Vulcans have certain mental (a Klingon walks past) certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield. Without those disciplines, there would be no protection. 
SPOCK: I'm sorry, sir. We did not notice you. 
SPOCK: Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem. Accomplishing our mission here. 
SPOCK: I thought you might. 
SPOCK: We'll receive no help from the Organians. 
SPOCK: Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective. Perhaps a more direct approach? 
SPOCK: You did. 
SPOCK: A very meritorious idea, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary. It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: With a delayed action fuse. 
SPOCK: These crates contain chemical explosives. They should make a most satisfactory display. 
SPOCK: Six, five, four three. 
SPOCK: Our fleet will eventually arrive. In the meantime, the battle is ours. It can be a successful one. 
SPOCK: It's no use, Jim. There's no way out. 
SPOCK: Six hours, forty three minutes, if the Klingons are punctual. 
SPOCK: They do not seem to understand. Most peculiar. 
SPOCK: We may not get the chance, Captain. These walls are very thick. 
SPOCK: Nor do we understand what happened to the guard at the citadel. 
SPOCK: Indeed, there are several questions I would like to ask as well. 
SPOCK: It would appear so, Captain. 
SPOCK: But only two. More Organians will die. 
SPOCK: Difficult to be precise, Captain. I should say approximately 7,824.7 to 1. 
SPOCK: 7,824.7 to 1. 
SPOCK: I endeavour to be accurate. 
SPOCK: Very good. 
SPOCK: Clear, Captain. 
SPOCK: Less than seven thousand to one, Captain. It's remarkable we've got this far. 
SPOCK: (taking his weapon) I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition. 
SPOCK: You may be premature. There are many possibilities. 
SPOCK: Inexplicable, Captain. Extreme heat. Not only the weapons but the bodies as well. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Pure energy. Pure thought. Totally incorporeal. Not life as we know it at all. 
SPOCK: Conventionalisations, I should say. Useless to the Organians. Created so that visitors such as ourselves, could have conventional points of reference. 
SPOCK: We have seen it with our own eyes. I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba. 
SPOCK: You've been most restrained since we left Organia. 
SPOCK: Captain, it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are. Even the gods did not spring into being overnight. You and I have no reason to be embarrassed. We did, after all, beat the odds. 
SPOCK: I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain. 
SPOCK: This is of great scientific importance, Captain. We're actually passing through ripples in time. 
SPOCK: All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be fairly heavy displacement. 
SPOCK: The hypo, Captain. 
SPOCK: Empty. 
SPOCK: Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might 
SPOCK: And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the centre of the time disturbance. 
SPOCK: And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries old. 
SPOCK: Unbelievable, Captain. 
SPOCK: This single object is the source of all the time displacement. 
SPOCK: I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away. 
SPOCK: Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand mechanics. 
SPOCK: I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles. 
SPOCK: A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct. 
SPOCK: Really. 
SPOCK: Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish 
SPOCK: I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever 
SPOCK: With no past, no future. 
SPOCK: I was recording images at the time McCoy left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the correct time. A week, if we're fortunate. 
SPOCK: There is no alternative. 
SPOCK: Seconds now, sir. Stand by. 
SPOCK: And now. 
SPOCK: It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case, Captain. 
SPOCK: That should prove interesting. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Theft, Captain? 
SPOCK: You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it. 
SPOCK: Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child. 
SPOCK: Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you. 
SPOCK: Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer. 
SPOCK: First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain. 
SPOCK: There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash. 
SPOCK: Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating. Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images of what he did. If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's computers for just a few moments. 
SPOCK: In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture? 
SPOCK: At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My hobby. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course, Captain. 
SPOCK: Speculation. Gifted insight. 
SPOCK: We have a what, Captain? 
SPOCK: One might have said so in the first place. 
SPOCK: Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through there to be used as a duodynetic field core...
SPOCK: Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins. 
SPOCK: Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits. 
SPOCK: I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins. 
SPOCK: Captain. Tools for finely detailed work. 
SPOCK: I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning. 
SPOCK: Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? 
SPOCK: I'll finish with the furnace. 
SPOCK: I may have found our focal point in time. 
SPOCK: Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our answer on this screen, Captain. 
SPOCK: And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing. 
SPOCK: I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex. 
SPOCK: Bad enough. 
SPOCK: It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article. 
SPOCK: Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary. Some sort of traffic accident. 
SPOCK: Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to. 
SPOCK: Is the random element. 
SPOCK: Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which. 
SPOCK: Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die? 
SPOCK: I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt. 
SPOCK: Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits. 
SPOCK: This is how history went after McCoy changed it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War. While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments. 
SPOCK: Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement. 
SPOCK: She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world. 
SPOCK: And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim. 
SPOCK: We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry. 
SPOCK: Jim, Edith Keeler must die. 
SPOCK: Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop. 
SPOCK: I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her. 
SPOCK: We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and millions will die who did not die before. 
SPOCK: What is it? 
SPOCK: No, Jim! 
SPOCK: He knows, Doctor. He knows. 
SPOCK: We were successful. 
SPOCK: As I speculated, Captain, the overall pattern of mass insanity destroying civilisations follows an almost straight line through this section of the galaxy. Over here the Beta Portilin system the ancient civilisations. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that they were the beginning. Two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity, then Theta Cygni Twelve. The last was Ingraham B, two years ago. 
SPOCK: The ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain. He does not seem to be out of control. His course is straight for the sun. 
SPOCK: Outer hull temperature now four hundred and eighty degrees and rising. 
SPOCK: So are we. Hull temperature one thousand degrees and rising. The sun's gravimetric pull increasing. 
SPOCK: All clear, Captain. Hull temperature falling, gravimetric pull approaching tolerance level. 
SPOCK: Planet development is normal, Captain. Originally colonised as a freighting-line base in this area. 
SPOCK: No Federation contacts for over a year. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura has had no further response to our signals. Sensors report the expected number of humans on the planet surface. However, they are strangely quiet. Very little activity. 
SPOCK: They're here, Captain. In the buildings. Strangely quiescent. 
SPOCK: Captain, several people approaching. 
SPOCK: Indeed. They seemed most concerned for our safety. 
SPOCK: Their attitude was inconsistent with their actions. 
SPOCK: Captain, I understand how you must 
SPOCK: Notice the ventilator, Captain. Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in. Obviously they were not entirely successful. 
SPOCK: That is correct. I am at a loss to understand it. 
SPOCK: The streets are extraordinarily quiet, Captain. We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out. 
SPOCK: A peculiar buzzing sound. We were about to investigate it. 
SPOCK: Incredible. Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it does not even register on my tricorder. 
SPOCK: It is not life as we know or understand it. Yet t is obviously alive, it exists. 
SPOCK: Captain, I suggest we risk taking it aboard. 
SPOCK: No! No! (he sits up) 
SPOCK: (hoarsely) No, I won't. 
SPOCK: I must take the ship.
SPOCK: Down! I must take it down. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy. Captain. 
SPOCK: These restraints will no longer be necessary. Nor will your sedatives, Doctor. I'll be able to return to duty. I apologise for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship. I simply did not understand. 
SPOCK: I am a Vulcan, Doctor. Pain is a thing of the mind. The mind can be controlled. 
SPOCK: It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable. And the creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me. (the pain indicator hits the top of the monitor) It wants this ship, but I am resisting. 
SPOCK: I have my own will, Captain. Let me help. 
SPOCK: I am a Vulcan. I am a Vulcan. There is no pain. 
SPOCK: I was. 
SPOCK: I have an errand on the planet's surface. You will beam me down to the same co-ordinates as before. 
SPOCK: That is an order, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Until the pain was gone, Captain. It has been discontinued by me. 
SPOCK: One of the creatures will have to be captured and analysed, Captain. We did not have a clear opportunity to do so earlier when I was attacked. Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me. 
SPOCK: I am in complete control of myself, Doctor. The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Captain. 
SPOCK: Come in, gentlemen. I believe you'll find this interesting. (McCoy scans Spock.) Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right. 
SPOCK: Unimportant at the moment, Doctor. Please observe. Interesting, gentlemen. A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell. 
SPOCK: Do you understand what I'm suggesting, Captain? 
SPOCK: And although it is not physically connected to the other cells, it is nevertheless part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons. 
SPOCK: From a place where our physical laws do not apply. We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: I regret I see no other choice for you, Captain. We already know this thing has destroyed three civilisations. Perhaps more. 
SPOCK: Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew. Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people. 
SPOCK: I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface. I also suggest that your nephew accompany me. 
SPOCK: Captain, I do not make this request lightly. I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain. But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness. 
SPOCK: It exists physically. It occupies space. It has mass, therefore gravity. It converts matter to energy. 
SPOCK: A possibility. 
SPOCK: Yes. In essence, it can be done. A string of satellites around the planet with burning tri-magnesite and trevium. 
SPOCK: Of course. The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was one million candles per square inch. If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected by it. 
SPOCK: Captain, you'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body. I am the logical choice. 
SPOCK: There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor. 
SPOCK: The creature within me is gone. I am free of it and the pain. 
SPOCK: And I'm also quite blind. An equitable trade, Doctor. Thank you. 
SPOCK: Interesting. Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light which we cannot see. 
SPOCK: Doctor it was my selection as well. It is done. 
SPOCK: An hereditary trait, Captain. The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light. Totally instinctive, Doctor. We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix. 
SPOCK: Quite the contrary, Captain. I had a very strong reaction. My first sight was the face of Doctor McCoy bending over me. 
SPOCK: My pleasure, Captain. 
SPOCK: Why, thank you, Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK: One degree to overlap. Stand by to photograph. Now.
SPOCK: Negative, Lieutenant. We are the first to reach this far.
SPOCK: Deflectors, full intensity.
SPOCK: Evasive maneuvers, Mister Sulu.
SPOCK: Sound alarm.
SPOCK: Countermand alarm. All engines full stop.
SPOCK: Ahead slow. Steer a course around it, Mister Sulu.
SPOCK: Quite unnecessary to raise your voice, Mister Bailey. All engines stop. Sound the alert.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Have a look at this, Captain.
SPOCK [OC]: Undetermined. Whatever it is, it's blocking our way. When we move, it moves as well.
SPOCK [OC]: Negative. More some type of device.
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here.
SPOCK [OC]: Negative. Whatever it is, it seems to just want to hold us here.
SPOCK [OC]: Negative.
SPOCK: All decks have reported green, Mister Bailey.
SPOCK: And when the Captain arrives he will expect a full report on 
SPOCK: It does sound most inconvenient, however. Have you considered having it removed?
SPOCK [on monitor]: Spock here.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Negative.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Affirmative. No answer from the cube.
SPOCK [on monitor]: Already standing by. 
SPOCK: Reporting, sir. Sensors show it is solid, but its composition is unknown to us.
SPOCK: I believe it adds up to either one of two possibilities. First, a space buoy of some kind. 
SPOCK: Flypaper.
SPOCK: Negative. It would make us appear too weak.
SPOCK: Radiation from the short end of the spectrum increasing.
SPOCK: Radiation increasing.
SPOCK: Radiation nearing the tolerance level.
SPOCK: Radiation at the tolerance level.
SPOCK: Radiation passing the tolerance level, entering lethal zone.
SPOCK: Growing. We can take only a few more seconds of this.
SPOCK: Nothing, Captain. No contacts, no objects in any direction.
SPOCK: Speculate? No. Logically, we'll discover the intelligence which sent out the cube.
SPOCK: Probably both, and if you're asking the logical decision to make 
SPOCK: Has it occurred to you that there's a certain inefficiency in constantly questioning me on things you've already made up your mind about?
SPOCK [OC]: Exercise rating, Captain. Ninety four percent.
SPOCK [OC]: Agreed.
SPOCK [OC]: We're picking up an object, sir. Much larger, coming toward us.
SPOCK: Exceptionally strong contact. Not visual yet. Distant spectrograph. Metallic, similar to cube. Much greater energy reading.
SPOCK: Tractor beam, Captain. Something's grabbed us, hard.
SPOCK: Fascinating.
SPOCK: Reading goes off my scale, Captain. Must be a mile in diameter.
SPOCK: Captain, we're being invaded by exceptionally strong sensor probes everywhere. Our electrical systems, our engines.
SPOCK: They're shutting off some of our systems, Captain. Brilliant. Extremely sophisticated in their methods.
SPOCK: Enough to warn other Earth ships.
SPOCK: Marker on course. Heading back the way we (big bang)
SPOCK: Might be interesting to see what they look like if I can locate where that voice is coming from. (McCoy and Scott enter) 
SPOCK: Switching to screen. I believe I can get something visual.
SPOCK: I was curious to see how they appeared.
SPOCK: Jim.
SPOCK: They're certainly aware by now that we're totally incapable of it.
SPOCK: In chess, when one is outmatched, the game is over. Checkmate.
SPOCK: I'm s, I regret that I can find no other logical alternative.
SPOCK: However, it was well played. I regret not having learned more about this Balok. In some manner he was reminiscent of my father.
SPOCK: Quite the contrary. She considered herself a very fortunate Earth woman.
SPOCK: A very interesting game, this poker.
SPOCK: I have visual contact, Captain.
SPOCK: About two thousand metric tons.
SPOCK: Engine systems coming on, Captain.
SPOCK: Tractor beam again.
SPOCK: He's sneaked power down a bit.
SPOCK: We're superheating. Intermix temperature, seven thousand four hundred degrees. Seven five, seven six, eight thousand degrees. (everything is juddering, the little ship is getting brighter and brighter)
SPOCK: Two thousand degrees above maximum. Eight four, eight five, eight six. She'll blow soon!
SPOCK: That may not be wise. He got a signal through to the mother ship.
SPOCK: For it, Captain?
SPOCK: Captain, request permission to
SPOCK: They may have nothing to report. Our sensors indicate no life forms except our landing party. 
SPOCK: No cloud formations, no bodies of water, no changes in surface temperature. Under these conditions, fog is highly unlikely, Captain. According to our transporter co-ordinates this is the exact location from which Jackson was beamed up to the ship. 
SPOCK: No indications of. A moment, Captain. Picking up life form readings. Twenty four degrees mark seven. Range one thirty seven point one six metres. Multiple readings, Captain. 
SPOCK: No change, Captain. 
SPOCK: Very bad poetry, Captain. 
SPOCK: What we've just seen is not real. 
SPOCK: However, on azimuth twenty four, at just over one hundred metres, there are definitely life forms. Erratic, confused, but definitely registering. 
SPOCK: This is the source of the life form readings, Captain. They're inside, somewhere. 
SPOCK: I would say not, Captain. There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference. 
SPOCK: Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside. 
SPOCK: Trick or treat, Captain? 
SPOCK: That would seem to be in order. 
SPOCK: The readings would so indicate. 
SPOCK: Yes. I am undamaged, Captain. 
SPOCK: I do not know, Captain, but these things do exist. They are real. 
SPOCK: As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level. 
SPOCK: Neither did Jackson just before he collapsed. 
SPOCK: Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before. There never have been any life forms on Pyris Seven. 
SPOCK: There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars. 
SPOCK: Demons in animal forms sent by Satan to serve the wizard. 
SPOCK: I do not create the legend, Captain. I merely report it. 
SPOCK: Ingenious. 
SPOCK: Mind probing? Hypnosis? 
SPOCK: Telepathy? 
SPOCK: Not entirely, no. Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure you that I have full control over your friends. 
SPOCK: Twenty two minutes, seventeen seconds. 
SPOCK: I'm sure we'll find out shortly. Jim, all of these things that we've seen. To an Earthman like yourself, they must seem quite familiar. 
SPOCK: Precisely. I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious. The universal myths, symbols. 
SPOCK: And dungeons and castles and black cats. They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness. 
SPOCK: And they missed. They reached basically only the subconscious. Korob seemed puzzled by your reaction to the environment he'd provided. 
SPOCK: And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely for any life form we've met in this galaxy. 
SPOCK: Evidently something totally alien in all respects. 
SPOCK: I, too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action. 
SPOCK: You came in a ship? 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Racial memories. The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals, as far back as the sabre-toothed tiger. 
SPOCK: Ready when you are, Captain. 
SPOCK: Quickly, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Jim! 
SPOCK: Fortuitous, Captain. And now that we have them all together? (the cat arrives) A most unpleasant situation, Captain. If only your phaser had some power. 
SPOCK: Don't let her touch the wand, Captain. 
SPOCK: Jim! 
SPOCK: Fascinating. A life form totally alien to our galaxy. If we could preserve and study this 
SPOCK: We have reached projected point three, Captain. Adjust to new course two oh one mark one five. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Will you check your automatic scanner, please? 
SPOCK: Nor have I. 
SPOCK: Heading directly toward us at warp speed. 
SPOCK: Vaguely like a cloud of ionised hydrogen, but with strong erratic electrical impulses. 
SPOCK: Helm does not answer, Captain. 
SPOCK: Cut, Captain. 
SPOCK: Now on course nine eight mark one two, heading directly toward Gamma Canaris region. 
SPOCK: Gravity is similar to Earth. Most unusual in view of its size. The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel. More than an asteroid. Like a small planetoid, I should say. Possibly a remnant of a planet breakup. Totally suitable for human life. 
SPOCK: Most unusual. Unlikely. In fact, Captain, I would say quite impossible. 
SPOCK: Precisely. 
SPOCK: Obviously. 
SPOCK: The ionised cloud. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Correct. 
SPOCK: Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment. 
SPOCK: You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again? 
SPOCK: You don't mind if we continue to try? 
SPOCK: You built this, Mister Cochrane? 
SPOCK: Not bad. 
SPOCK: Captain, Doctor. 
SPOCK: We imagined nothing, Mister Cochrane. There was an entity out there and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here. Please explain. 
SPOCK: You were injured? 
SPOCK: I prefer to reserve judgment on that part of your story, sir. Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of yours is? 
SPOCK: The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the known galaxy. Planets were named after him. Great universities, cities. 
SPOCK: True, his body was never found. 
SPOCK: If so, you wear your age very well. 
SPOCK: Captain. These instruments, they date from the time indicated. From your ship, Mister Cochrane? 
SPOCK: You ask me to find a weapon. Do you intend to destroy it? 
SPOCK: Quite clear, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes. Quite all right, Doctor. A most fascinating thing happened. Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage. 
SPOCK: Evidently. Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity. 
SPOCK: Quite correct, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Put this in the proximity of the Companion, throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce. It cannot fail. 
SPOCK: We may simply render it powerless. 
SPOCK: There is some risk, Captain. We do not know the extent of its powers. 
SPOCK: All right. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain? 
SPOCK: The translator is for use with more congruent life forms. 
SPOCK: It is possible. If I could widen its pattern of reception 
SPOCK: Then it translates its findings into English. 
SPOCK: Quite ready, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes. The matter of gender could change the entire situation. 
SPOCK: Then it is not a zookeeper. 
SPOCK: This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge. Ask it about its nature, its history. 
SPOCK: A chance like this may never come again. It could tell us so much. 
SPOCK: Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us. Her appearance is soft, gentle. Her voice is melodic, pleasing. I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists. The Companion loves you. 
SPOCK: Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical. Your relationship with the Companion has for one hundred and fifty years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless. It may indeed have been quite beneficial. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. A totally parochial attitude. 
SPOCK: But she or it is inhuman, Captain. You cannot expect her to react like a human. 
SPOCK: Companion, you do not have the power to create life. 
SPOCK: Commissioner Hedford was dying. 
SPOCK: Then you are both here, in the one body? 
SPOCK: Not coming from a human being. You are, after all, essentially irrational. 
SPOCK: But you will age, both of you. There will be no immortality. You'll both grow old here and finally die. 
SPOCK: Ordinarily, under these circumstances, I would recommend a large, well-armed landing party. 
SPOCK: He also mentioned that they can be highly dangerous. 
SPOCK: Inefficient, however. Emotion, Captain. 
SPOCK: It would appear, Captain, that he finds you a disappointment. 
SPOCK: Our check-in signal is one hour, twelve minutes overdue. Since no reconnaissance party has appeared, and since Mister Scott is notably efficient in such matters 
SPOCK: That would seem a logical conclusion. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain, an excellent idea. 
SPOCK: But a defensible entrance, Captain. 
SPOCK: The walls get higher and narrower, but there is a way out. 
SPOCK: There is enough loose rock and shale. 
SPOCK: Only a very slight chance it would work. 
SPOCK: Captain, I didn't say that exactly. 
SPOCK: The sound beams should produce a sympathetic vibration on the weak area of that slide. 
SPOCK: There would seem to be little weapon potential at hand. 
SPOCK: Fortunately, this bark has suitable tensile cohesion. 
SPOCK: I believe I said that. 
SPOCK: I would rather, I would rather not. Thank you. 
SPOCK: That should prove very interesting. 
SPOCK: The child? 
SPOCK: Virtue is a relative term, Doctor. She'll head straight to the warriors. 
SPOCK: Here, Captain. Over here, Captain. (into communicator as Kirk joins him.) Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: If by that you mean we can't expect help from the Enterprise, I must agree. 
SPOCK: The Klingon? 
SPOCK: Revenge, Captain? 
SPOCK: Oochy-woochy coochy-coo, Captain? 
SPOCK: Well, at any rate, this should prove interesting. 
SPOCK: When the woman starts explaining how the new high teer is actually Doctor McCoy's child. 
SPOCK: Nor does Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK: The child's regent? 
SPOCK: The child was named Leonard James Akaar? 
SPOCK: I think you're both going to be insufferably pleased with yourselves for at least a month, sir. 
SPOCK: Pollux Four. Class M type planet, oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere. Sensors indicate no life forms. Approximate age four billion years. Judged no reason for contact. In all respects, quite ordinary, Captain. 
SPOCK: Momentarily. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Not living tissue. 
SPOCK: Not a projection, sir. A field of energy. 
SPOCK: The ship is almost completely encircled by the field. It resembles a conventional force field but on unusual wavelengths. Despite its appearance, that of a human appendage, it is definitely not living tissue. It is energy. 
SPOCK: Captain, a most curious development on scanner five seven. 
SPOCK: Screen on, Captain. 
SPOCK: Verbose, isn't he? 
SPOCK: Insults are effective only where emotion is present. 
SPOCK: Try to break through it, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Very efficient. Mister Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for maximum power generation. Compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Kyle, I want a complete sensor scan of the planet. 
SPOCK: Locate all the lifeforms. I want to know what's going on down there. 
SPOCK: Ready to reverse polarity, Mister Sulu? 
SPOCK: Activate all units. 
SPOCK: Cut power, Mister Sulu. Lieutenant, we must restore communications with the landing party. 
SPOCK: Oh? 
SPOCK: Good. Do so. Sensor report, Mister Kyle. 
SPOCK: And Apollo? 
SPOCK: Origin? 
SPOCK: I would suggest, Mister Sulu, if you cannot find out where the power source is, you should find out where it is not. A simple process of elimination. 
SPOCK: Progress report. 
SPOCK: Speed is essential, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: I can think no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura. Please proceed. 
SPOCK: Progress, Mister Sulu? 
SPOCK: Continue the search. 
SPOCK: Mister Kyle. 
SPOCK: We're unable to break completely loose from this force field, but we might be able to punch some holes through it. 
SPOCK: To shoot through. It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's communications problem. Take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab. I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas. That might be done by generating a strong pinpoint charge of M-rays on some of these selected wave lengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines. 
SPOCK: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface which seems to have something to do with the force field. 
SPOCK: Is there a structure of some sort near you? 
SPOCK [OC]: The power emanates from there. 
SPOCK: We can negate sections of it, creating openings through which we can fire our phaser banks. 
SPOCK: Captain. I would recommend a discreet distance. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock, Captain. 
SPOCK: Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, you're too close. 
SPOCK: More power to the shields. 
SPOCK: All banks maintain firing rate. 
SPOCK [OC]: What is this? 
SPOCK [OC]: Poking and prying! If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it! 
SPOCK: Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence on my home planet. On our present course you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but two point eight light days. 
SPOCK: I have made my request, Captain. All I require from you is that you answer it. Yes or no. 
SPOCK: It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers. 
SPOCK: You have my request, Captain. Will you grant it or not? 
SPOCK: Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated. 
SPOCK: No. Nothing of that nature, Captain. 
SPOCK: No! I must. I wish to take my leave on Vulcan. 
SPOCK: I need rest. I'm asking you to accept that answer. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Captain. 
SPOCK: No. (looking at his shaking hand) We're not. 
SPOCK: I quite understand, Captain. 
SPOCK: Changed the course? 
SPOCK: No. No, by no means, Captain. It is quite possible. 
SPOCK: Captain, I accept on your word that I did it, but I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it. Captain, lock me away. I do not wish to be seen. I cannot. No Vulcan could explain further. 
SPOCK: Ask me no further questions. I will not answer. 
SPOCK: Sickbay? 
SPOCK: My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor. I have done so. And now I'll go to my quarters. 
SPOCK: Examine me, for all the good it'll do either of us. 
SPOCK: Come. 
SPOCK: It is a thing no out-worlder may know except those very few who have been involved. A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves. It is a deeply personal thing. Can you see that, Captain, and understand? 
SPOCK: Captain, there are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service. 
SPOCK: It has to do with biology. 
SPOCK: Biology. 
SPOCK: Vulcan biology. 
SPOCK: The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain. If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us. How do Vulcans choose their mates? Haven't you wondered? 
SPOCK: No. No. It is not. We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity. You humans have no conception. It strips our minds from us. It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation. It is the pon farr. The time of mating. There are precedents in nature, Captain. The giant eelbirds of Regulus Five, once each eleven years they must return to the caverns where they hatched. On your Earth, the salmon. They must return to that one stream where they were born, to spawn or die in trying. 
SPOCK: No. Nor am I a man. I'm a Vulcan. I'd hoped I would be spared this, but the ancient drives are too strong. Eventually, they catch up with us, and we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife. Or die. 
SPOCK: Let me alone. Let me alone! 
SPOCK: Miss Chapel. 
SPOCK: I had a most startling dream. You were trying to tell me something, but I couldn't hear you. It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures. Don't you think? 
SPOCK: Your face is wet. 
SPOCK: Vulcan. Miss Chapel. 
SPOCK: Yes, I know, Christine. Would you make me some of that plomeek soup? 
SPOCK: It is obvious that you have surmised my problem, Doctor. My compliments on your insight. Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time. Almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful. 
SPOCK: Then would you beam down to the planet's surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony. 
SPOCK: It is my right. By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends. 
SPOCK: I also request McCoy accompany me. 
SPOCK: This is Spock. 
SPOCK: T'Pring, parted from me and never parted, never and always touching and touched. We meet at the appointed place. 
SPOCK: She is T'Pring. My wife. 
SPOCK: This is the land of my family. It has been held by us for more than two thousand Earth years. This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee, 
SPOCK: The marriage party approaches. I hear them. 
SPOCK: By our parents' arrangement. A ceremony while we were but seven years of age. Less than a marriage but more than a betrothal. One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts. In this way our minds were locked together, so that at the proper time, we would both be drawn to Koon-ut-kal-if-fee. 
SPOCK: They are not outworlders. They are my friends. I am permitted this. 
SPOCK: This is Kirk. 
SPOCK: With my life, T'Pau. 
SPOCK: T'Pau. 
SPOCK: My friend does not understand. 
SPOCK: He does not know. I will do what I must, T'Pau, but not with him! His blood does not burn. He is my friend! 
SPOCK: I burn, T'Pau. My eyes are flame. My heart is flame. Thee has the power, T'Pau. In the name of my fathers, forbid. Forbid! T'Pau. I plead with thee! I beg! 
SPOCK: Yes. I'll follow you up in a few minutes. You will instruct Mister Chekov to plot a course for the nearest Starbase where I must surrender myself to the authorities. (the sound of a transporter off screen) T'Pring. Explain. 
SPOCK: Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion. 
SPOCK: I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me. 
SPOCK: Logical. Flawlessly logical. 
SPOCK: Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper. 
SPOCK: I shall do neither. I have killed my captain and my friend. Energize. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course. 
SPOCK: So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements. 
SPOCK: Doctor, please, let me finish. There can be no excuse for the crime of which I'm guilty. I intend to offer no defence. Furthermore, I shall order Mister Scott to take immediate command of this vessel. 
SPOCK: Captain! Jim! 
SPOCK: I'm pleased to see you, Captain. You seem uninjured. I am at something of a loss to understand it, however. 
SPOCK: Indeed. 
SPOCK: Ah, yes, the girl. Most interesting. It must have been the combat. When I thought I had killed the captain, I found I had lost all interest in T'Pring. The madness was gone. 
SPOCK: Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Captain. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed. Nothing left but rubble and asteroids. 
SPOCK: Nonetheless, Captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year. 
SPOCK: Captain, the two inner most planets of this system appear to be intact. 
SPOCK: I have it on the sensors, Captain. By configuration, a starship stopped in space. She appears to be drifting. 
SPOCK: Sensors not recording normal energy output. 
SPOCK: She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems. 
SPOCK: All power plants dead, reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level. 
SPOCK: Also operative at a low power level. The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable. The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life. 
SPOCK: Normal, but subspace interference makes readings difficult. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK [OC]: Enterprise, Spock here. 
SPOCK: Improbable, Captain. The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead. The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference. 
SPOCK [OC]: Attempting to remedy. 
SPOCK: She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot, an automated weapon of immense size and power. Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel. It is, therefore, self-sustaining as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. However, Mister Sulu has computed the path of the machine, using the destroyed solar systems as a base course. Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside, from another galaxy. 
SPOCK: If it follows its present path, it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy. 
SPOCK [OC]: Red alert! Red alert! 
SPOCK: It came up on us fast, Captain, but we seem able to maintain our distance. 
SPOCK: It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer. And it is pursuing us. (The viewscreen now shows it head-on. A round opening with a small sun partway down the gullet.) 
SPOCK: We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us. Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive. 
SPOCK [OC]: No evidence of life, subspace interference level incredibly high. 
SPOCK: I would say none, Captain. The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attracts it. I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves. 
SPOCK [OC]: I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms. 
SPOCK: Closing, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK [OC]: Transporter Room, stand by to beam landing party aboard. 
SPOCK: Evasive action, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Damage report, all stations. 
SPOCK: Affect repairs. Captain Kirk, come in please. 
SPOCK: Captain, we've been attacked. The transporter is damaged. We're taking evasive action. 
SPOCK [OC]: Damage in communications, Captain. Interference will (static) 
SPOCK: We have outrun it, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Impulse and warp engines operative, transporter and communications under repair. Random chance seems to have operated in our favour. 
SPOCK: I believe I said that, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius. We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the Captain. 
SPOCK: I am aware of the Rigel system's population, Commodore, but we are only one ship. Our deflector shields are strained, our subspace transmitter is useless. Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation. 
SPOCK: You will carry out my last order, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it. 
SPOCK: You tried to destroy it once before, Commodore. The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew. 
SPOCK: Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium. A single ship cannot combat it. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative. Paragraph 1A clearly states 
SPOCK: If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C. 
SPOCK: You'll also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it. 
SPOCK: Then your statement would not be considered valid. 
SPOCK: Deflector shields at full power. They can't take much more of this. 
SPOCK: Deflectors holding, but weakening. We must retreat, Commodore. The energy drain 
SPOCK: Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal. 
SPOCK; Sir, deflector shields are gone. 
SPOCK: It has ceased fire. We're being held in a tractor beam. We're being pulled inside, Commodore. You must veer off. 
SPOCK: We have lost warp power. If we don't break the tractor beam within sixty seconds, we never will. 
SPOCK: That, sir, is illogical. It is suicide. Attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command. If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis. 
SPOCK: Emergency impulse power. 
SPOCK; We need more power. 
SPOCK: It's closing fast on the Constellation. 
SPOCK: Commodore, I suggest 
SPOCK: This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere. Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack. 
SPOCK: Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day. Repairs proceeding on transporter and communications. 
SPOCK: We can maintain this speed for only seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely. 
SPOCK: Illogical. We cannot destroy it. Therefore, we cannot save Rigel. We must transport the Captain and the others from the Constellation and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn Starfleet Command. 
SPOCK: Can you raise Starfleet? 
SPOCK: On audio, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Commodore. 
SPOCK: Warp drive out. Deflector shields down. Transporter under repair. We are on emergency impulse power. 
SPOCK [OC]: At least one solar day. 
SPOCK: At our present rate of consumption, we'll exhaust our impulse power long before then. 
SPOCK: Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command. 
SPOCK: You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming we survive to reach a Starbase. But you are relieved. Commodore. I do not wish to place you under arrest. 
SPOCK: Vulcans never bluff. 
SPOCK: Captain, I have assumed command. 
SPOCK: One moment, sir. Commodore. I believe you are scheduled for medical examination. Mister Montgomery. 
SPOCK: You will accompany the commodore to Sickbay. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, change course. Seven zero mark two one. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you. We will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Shut them, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Whoever it is, Captain, has no authorisation. Lieutenant, raise the shuttlecraft. 
SPOCK: Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship. 
SPOCK: You cannot succeed, Commodore. Your only logical alternative is to return to the ship. 
SPOCK: He's gone. Constellation, come in, please. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk, come in please. 
SPOCK: Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death of your friend. It is most regrettable. 
SPOCK: The drop in power is definite, Captain but negligible. The object is still pursing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate. 
SPOCK: Transporter operational, Captain. Shall we beam you aboard? 
SPOCK: There's little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Transporter Room. Beam damage control party aboard. 
SPOCK: No, sir. Ninety seven point eight three five megatons. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Its hull is pure neutronium. There is no known way of blasting through it. 
SPOCK: Insufficient data. I shall try to take further sensor readings. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain? 
SPOCK: The object's neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible. 
SPOCK [OC]: Correct. 
SPOCK: Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer. 
SPOCK: Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker. 
SPOCK: Your chances of survival are not promising. We don't even know if the explosion will be powerful enough. 
SPOCK [OC]: There's another factor, Captain. The transporter is not working at one hundred percent efficiency. 
SPOCK: Thirty seconds is very slim timing. 
SPOCK [OC]: Transporter, stand by. 
SPOCK: Transporter is out, Captain. You'll have to stand by. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Scott, speed is of the essence. 
SPOCK: Captain, transporter operational, but just barely. 
SPOCK: Transporter, stand by. 
SPOCK: Energise. 
SPOCK [OC]: We can't, Captain. Transporter is out again. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, twenty seconds to detonation. 
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott 
SPOCK [OC]: Try inverse phasing. 
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Energy output zero. Radiation level normal. 
SPOCK: Welcome aboard, Captain. Sensors show all energy sources deactivated. It's quite dead. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. I presume your log will show that Commodore Decker died in the line of duty. 
SPOCK: Appropriate, Captain. However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe. 
SPOCK: Enterprise. Spock here. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Co-ordinates received. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. May I have a word with you? 
SPOCK: Concerning the situation you related to us. In my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting phenomenon, but the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life. 
SPOCK: Simply that we beam Mister Scott on board the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth. 
SPOCK: Quite clear, Captain. 
SPOCK: Anger is a relative state, sir. Were you angry enough to do violence? 
SPOCK: Sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, Captain. 
SPOCK: To us, perhaps, but to the computer? 
SPOCK: Computer, linguistic bank. Definition of following word. Redjac. 
SPOCK: There is no such word in the linguistics bank? 
SPOCK: Scan all other banks. 
SPOCK: Define. 
SPOCK: Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of. There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal. 
SPOCK: In the strict scientific sense, Doctor, we all feed on death. Even vegetarians. 
SPOCK: Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human. Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions. 
SPOCK: Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes. Correlate hypotheses. Compare with life forms register. Question. Could such an entity within discussed limits exist in this galaxy? 
SPOCK: Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity. 
SPOCK: Working. To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense. Most probable mass of energy of highly cohesive electromagnetic field. 
SPOCK: I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth and was never identified. 
SPOCK: I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer. 
SPOCK: And I suspect preys on women because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species. 
SPOCK: Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth. 
SPOCK: I can appreciate your position, sir. You are in charge of civil disturbances locally. If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity? 
SPOCK: An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep. The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold. 
SPOCK: Computer. Report on analysis of Exhibit A. 
SPOCK: Specify. Point of origin. 
SPOCK: The computer will not respond to these controls. The entity is unquestionably controlling it. 
SPOCK: It's no use, Captain. The bypass circuits are blocked. 
SPOCK: Indeed, it will try, but not immediately. We know it feeds on fear and terror. There are nearly four hundred and forty humans aboard this ship. Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills. 
SPOCK: Yes we do, Captain, but with the entity in control 
SPOCK: Indeed. If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them. 
SPOCK: Apparently our friends learned very quickly. 
SPOCK: Freefall! 
SPOCK: We don't have much time, Captain. 
SPOCK: Normal environmental levels have been restored, Captain, but it will not last long. A few hours at best. 
SPOCK: Proceeding, Captain, but I will need some time. 
SPOCK: It is attempting to generate terror, Captain. 
SPOCK: Ready. 
SPOCK: Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive. Compute to the last digit the value of pi. 
SPOCK: As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution. The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else until we order it to stop. 
SPOCK: There is resistance, Captain, but the directive is succeeding. Bank after bank is turning to the problem. 
SPOCK: Complete computer control, Captain. The entity has fled. 
SPOCK: Possibly, Doctor. Its consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless. 
SPOCK: Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity. 
SPOCK: Captain. They will not answer. The long-range sensor sweep of this system reveals no sign of life. 
SPOCK: I register no life readings at all, sir. 
SPOCK: We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue. Our instruments show only normal background radiation. 
SPOCK: Unknown, sir. Sensor readings would have revealed the presence of any disease organisms. They do not. In addition, we received the routine report from this system only a week ago. Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly. 
SPOCK: An extremely powerful bolt of energy, Captain. 
SPOCK: Temporarily, Captain. Our shields absorbed energy equivalent to ninety of our photon torpedoes. 
SPOCK: I may add, the energy used repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power twenty percent. 
SPOCK: We can resist three more such attacks. The fourth will shatter our shields completely. 
SPOCK: Approximately warp fifteen, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. Nothing within sensor range. (a third bolt approaching) Something now, Captain. Very small. Bearing one two three degrees, mark one eight. Range ninety thousand kilometres. 
SPOCK: No, sir. Holding steady. 
SPOCK: No effect. Target absorbed full energy of our torpedo. 
SPOCK: They are in good working order, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, shields are down. We cannot survive another hit. 
SPOCK: Computing now, Captain. Weight, five hundred kilograms. Shape, roughly cylindrical. Length, a fraction over one metre. 
SPOCK: Intelligence does not necessarily require bulk, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Captain, this message is a sort of binary. Extremely sophisticated, compressed, carrying several channels at once. 
SPOCK: No clue as yet, Captain. A moment. Transmission speed has stepped down. Much slower. Seems to be a single binary. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: It would seem so, Captain. 
SPOCK: It's a formula, Captain. They're sending us a mathematical message and requesting language equivalence. They're trying to communicate. 
SPOCK: Cut power, Lieutenant. Overloaded and burned out. 
SPOCK: Nomad? 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. It has a protective screen. I cannot get through. 
SPOCK: A reasonable course. 
SPOCK: It is reacting much like a highly sophisticated computer. 
SPOCK: An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgment. 
SPOCK: Yes. It was reported destroyed. There were no more in the series. But if this is that probe 
SPOCK: Chart 14A, sir? 
SPOCK: I believe the history computer can answer that question. I'll have the readout in a moment. 
SPOCK: The usage is correct. The creator was simply testing your memory banks. 
SPOCK: I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe, and I'm convinced that this object is indeed that probe. 
SPOCK: True. 
SPOCK: Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision. I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself. 
SPOCK: This is the creator of Nomad, perhaps the most brilliant though erratic scientist of his time. His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic. You recall his name. 
SPOCK: Yes. Similar. Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk. That may well be why the attack was broken off. It responded to your name as well as its damaged memory banks permitted. 
SPOCK: Essentially it is, Doctor. I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision. It mentioned the other. The unanswered question is, the other what? 
SPOCK: Precisely, Doctor. And somehow that programming has been changed. It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life-forms, perfection being measured by its own relentless logic. 
SPOCK: Captain, Mister Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the auxiliary control room. 
SPOCK: That unit is a woman. 
SPOCK: Nomad, I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer. Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Well, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage but only knowledge erased, she could be re-educated. 
SPOCK: Does the creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere? 
SPOCK: Doctor, I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger. It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable. It almost qualifies as a life-form. 
SPOCK: The study of it would be of great use, Captain. 
SPOCK; Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: An almost human stubbornness, Captain. I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis. Without its co-operation, I can do nothing. 
SPOCK: Thank you. 
SPOCK: It is not sufficient, Captain. I get certain references to the accident, the other, but nothing clear. There are areas I simply cannot scan. 
SPOCK: Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe. 
SPOCK: It seems the only way. 
SPOCK: There is a risk, but I have formed a partial hypothesis. I must check it out. 
SPOCK: I. Am. Nomad. I am performing my function. Deep emptiness, It approaches. Collision. Damage. Blackness. I. Am. The other. I am Tan Ru, Tan Ru. Nomad. Tan Ru. Error. Flaw. Imperfection. Must sterilise. Rebirth. We are complete. Much power. Gun ta. Noo. Icka. Tan Ru. The creator instructs. Search out. Identify. Sterilise imperfections. We are Nomad. We are Nomad. We are complete. We are instructed. Our purpose is clear. Sterilise imperfections. (he lets go of Nomad) Sterilise imperfections. Nomad. Sterilise. Sterilise. Nomad, sterilise, 
SPOCK: Fascinating, Captain. The knowledge. The depth. 
SPOCK: It was, it was damaged in deep space. Undoubtedly, the meteor collision. Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them. It wandered without purpose, and then it met the other. The other was an alien probe of great power. Somehow they merged, repaired each other, became one. 
SPOCK: Not the Nomad we lost from Earth. It took from the other a new directive to replace its own. The other was originally programmed to secure and sterilise soil samples from other planets, probably as a prelude to colonisation. 
SPOCK: I beg your pardon? 
SPOCK And it has the power and sophistication to do it. 
SPOCK: And that is the only thing that has saved us until now. 
SPOCK: Captain. I've examined the brig. The forcefield door on the security cell is damaged and the guards have vanished. I must assume they are dead. 
SPOCK: I suspect it is about to re-evaluate its creator. Captain, it may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit. In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect. 
SPOCK: Even worse. Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth. 
SPOCK: I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities. 
SPOCK: It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units. 
SPOCK: No response. 
SPOCK: Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has completed its re-evaluation. 
SPOCK: Undoubtedly. 
SPOCK: Your logic was impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger. 
SPOCK: My congratulations, Captain. A dazzling display of logic. 
SPOCK: No, sir. 
SPOCK: Remarkable. 
SPOCK: The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, Captain. It was a remarkable instrument. 
SPOCK: Sir? 
SPOCK: The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, Captain. Husbandry would be quite efficacious. 
SPOCK: Oh, quite sure. Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this. Curious, even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature which maintains a planet-wide average of seventy six degrees. 
SPOCK: I find that most unusual, Captain. 
SPOCK: Indeed. Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions. 
SPOCK: Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing one eight. 
SPOCK: A visitor. One wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say. 
SPOCK: Anything? 
SPOCK: Interesting. Extremely low specific gravity, some uraninite, hornblende, quartz. (breaks it in half) Fragile, good cleavage. An analysis should prove interesting. 
SPOCK: Obviously highly unstable, Captain. This could be a find of some importance. In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power. 
SPOCK: If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier. 
SPOCK: If so, an immense one. Probably subterranean. 
SPOCK: (noticing a plant moving) Jim! 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my stomach. Other than that, I am quite well. 
SPOCK: I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so I 
SPOCK: I assure you, Captain, I had no intention of doing that. It was merely my own clumsiness prevented me which prevented me from moving out of the way. 
SPOCK: I shall do so. 
SPOCK: One hundred twenty two thousand two hundred 
SPOCK: Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system. 
SPOCK: Captain. Those co-ordinates are a short distance in that direction. 
SPOCK: Captain. In each case, this was unavoidable. 
SPOCK: I don't see how. 
SPOCK: You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture. 
SPOCK: No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe. You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do. Self-recriminations (he pauses) Captain, our friend is back. 
SPOCK: Mister Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient! 
SPOCK: Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice! 
SPOCK: Captain, this is fascinating. If you will permit me, sir? 
SPOCK: Fascinating. A very high order of workmanship, very ancient, generating great power. 
SPOCK: No, Captain. The centre is deep in the earth beneath us. This is an access point. It would also seem to be a 
SPOCK: Obviously. 
SPOCK: Yes, quite. It extends some thirty feet beyond the figure in all directions. Conventional in composition, and quite formidable. 
SPOCK: Yes, indeed it does, Captain. It makes me uncomfortable. 
SPOCK: Yes. Spock. I am Spock. 
SPOCK: I fail to see what they find so amusing. 
SPOCK: Quite possible. It checks with my atmospheric analysis. Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun. 
SPOCK: Apparently, our hypothesis is correct. There is no living being there. It is a machine, nothing more. 
SPOCK: Evidently not. This is no ordinary machine, Captain. It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence. 
SPOCK: That may not be of any help. The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK: In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures. I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy. 
SPOCK: Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them. 
SPOCK: Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy. What ever you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional reaction to it. 
SPOCK: I see no alternative. 
SPOCK: Well, I believe it's safe, (cough) safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions. 
SPOCK: I am concerned, Captain. This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one. 
SPOCK: If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion it will be in direct violation of the non-interference directive. 
SPOCK: Starfleet Command may think otherwise. 
SPOCK: Captain! 
SPOCK: Disturbing. The people of Vaal seem to have disappeared. 
SPOCK: Force field, Captain. 
SPOCK: Variation in impulses, Captain. I believe it is reading us. A strong jump on all wavelengths. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement. 
SPOCK: The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieved true human stature. I submit there is no cause for worry. They've taken the first step. They've learned to kill. 
SPOCK: Readings are getting weaker, Captain. Wide variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw on other sources. KIRK: Tapping its energy cells. 
SPOCK: I would assume so. 
SPOCK: If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves. 
SPOCK: A tremendous upsurge in generated power, Captain. Obviously Vaal is trying to reinforce his energy field. 
SPOCK: No power generation at all, Captain. Vaal is dead. 
SPOCK: That's not unusual, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli Six. 
SPOCK: Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis. 
SPOCK: Precisely, Captain, and in a manner of speaking, we have given the people of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil if you will, as a result of which they too have been driven out of paradise. 
SPOCK: Not at all, Captain. 
SPOCK: I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Standard ion type, Captain, but quite violent (Enterprise shakes) and unpredictable. 
SPOCK [OC]: If we stay. 
SPOCK: Comply, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: At norm, Mister Kyle. Controls at neutral. 
SPOCK: Status of mission, Captain? 
SPOCK: Standard procedure, Captain? (Kirk nods) Mister Sulu, you will programme phaser barrage on Halkan cities. 
SPOCK: Their military capability, Captain? 
SPOCK: Regrettable that this society has chosen suicide. Mister Kyle, you were instructed to compensate during the ion storm. 
SPOCK: Carelessness with the equipment cannot be tolerated. 
SPOCK: Your agoniser. 
SPOCK: Your agoniser, please. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, the storm has caused some minor damage in your section. There are also injuries requiring your attention, Doctor. Well, gentlemen? 
SPOCK: Yes. 
SPOCK: Due to your error, Mister Kyle? 
SPOCK: Possibly a result of the severe storm. Captain, do you feel any abnormal effects? 
SPOCK: Planet's rotation is carrying primary target beyond arc of phaser lock. 
SPOCK: Lock on to secondary city. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: But we cannot expect their co-operation. They have refused the Empire. Command procedure dictates that we provide the customary example. 
SPOCK: A serious breach of orders, Captain. 
SPOCK: Twelve hours, Captain? That is unprecedented. 
SPOCK: Captain, you've placed yourself in a most grave position. This conduct must be reported. 
SPOCK: I think not. Your authority on this ship is extremely limited, Captain. The four of you will remain her in the Brig and in custody until I discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong. 
SPOCK: I can answer none of your questions at this time. 
SPOCK: Apparently some kind of transposition has taken place. I find it extremely interesting. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am pleased that you frustrated Mister Chekov's plan. I should regret your death. 
SPOCK: I do not desire the captaincy. I much prefer my scientific duties. I am frankly content to be a lesser target. 
SPOCK: The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline. I presume you've ordered full duration. 
SPOCK: Indeed. His act warrants death. 
SPOCK: That is, of course, your affair. Captain, may I inquire if you intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the Halkans? 
SPOCK: They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure. You cannot ignore the consequences. 
SPOCK: I do not threaten, Captain. I merely state facts. I have found you to be an excellent officer. Our missions together have been both successful and profitable. However, I shall not permit your aberrations to jeopardise my position. 
SPOCK: Terror must be maintained or the Empire is doomed. It is the logic of history. 
SPOCK: Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you, but if you continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable behaviour, 
SPOCK: I'm aware of that, Captain. I trust that you are aware of the reverse. 
SPOCK: Mister Spock, Captain. 
SPOCK: I have received a private communication from Starfleet Command. I am committing a breach of regulations by informing you of its contents. 
SPOCK: I am instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission. 
SPOCK: In that event, I am ordered to kill you and to proceed against the Halkans as the new captain of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Computer? 
SPOCK: Explain computer activity in the engineering section. 
SPOCK: Who is conducting the research? 
SPOCK: What is the nature of the research? 
SPOCK: Why are you monitoring my communications, Mister Sulu? 
SPOCK: That is my concern. 
SPOCK: If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy. I do not want to command the Enterprise, but if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans. 
SPOCK: Please restrict your movements, Captain. 
SPOCK: I shall make that decision. Since your return from the planet, you've behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner. I want to know why. 
SPOCK: I shall not waste time with you. You're too inflexible, too disciplined once you've made up your mind. But Doctor McCoy has a plenitude of human weaknesses, sentimental, soft. You may not tell me what I want to know, but he will. 
SPOCK: I have the phaser, Captain, and I do not intend to simply disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past. If you please. Sickbay. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course. The entire landing party. Captain, stand over there. Doctor, it is time for answers. 
SPOCK: (sitting up and grabbing McCoy's arm) Why did the captain let me live? 
SPOCK: Our minds are merging, Doctor. Our minds are one. I feel what you feel. I know what you know. 
SPOCK: I cut the transporter power. It was necessary to delay your beam-out until I could arrive. Take him. 
SPOCK: Engineering, re-activate main transporter circuits. 
SPOCK: You must return to your universe. I must have my captain back. I shall operate the transporter. You have two minutes and ten seconds. 
SPOCK: Approximately two hundred and forty years. 
SPOCK: The Empire shall be overthrown, of course. 
SPOCK: You have one minute and twenty three seconds. 
SPOCK: One man cannot summon the future. 
SPOCK: A man must also have the power. 
SPOCK: Indeed? 
SPOCK: It is time. 
SPOCK: Captain Kirk, I shall consider it. 
SPOCK: Welcome home, Captain. 
SPOCK: It was far easier for you as civilised men to behave like barbarians, than it was for them as barbarians to behave like civilised men. I assume they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here. 
SPOCK: Indeed, gentlemen. May I point out that I had an opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely. They were brutal, savage, unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous, In every way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity. I found them quite refreshing. 
SPOCK: You've met her before, Captain? 
SPOCK: Your reaction, One of recognition. 
SPOCK: Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam from it.
SPOCK: Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard. 
SPOCK: Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three five. 
SPOCK: Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. 
SPOCK: How many more in your crew? 
SPOCK: What's wrong? 
SPOCK: It'll take longer on battery power. 
SPOCK: Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh? No other crewmen? 
SPOCK: You can explain that to the Captain. (the group leave) 
SPOCK: Deck twelve. 
SPOCK: The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Better rig a by-pass circuit. 
SPOCK: Needed on the bridge, Captain. 
SPOCK: The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal. 
SPOCK: And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it. 
SPOCK: There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore, I've heard. 
SPOCK: Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel. 
SPOCK: Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course. 
SPOCK: State your name for the record. 
SPOCK: Your correct name. 
SPOCK: State your correct name for the record. 
SPOCK: Any past offenses, Mister Mudd? 
SPOCK: We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours. 
SPOCK: Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful. Destroying them was a shame.&nbsp;
SPOCK: Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. 
SPOCK: We don't have the time to spare, Captain. 
SPOCK: The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult to probe through it. 
SPOCK: Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid zero four zero. 
SPOCK: There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove. 
SPOCK: Mudd? 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: How many coming, Captain? 
SPOCK: I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode. 
SPOCK: The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end. 
SPOCK: Our arrival was scheduled well in advance, Doctor. The annual check of every scientific expedition is routine. 
SPOCK: Quite impossible, Doctor. I ran a personnel check on this expedition before we beamed down. I assure you that none of them were 
SPOCK: Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life. The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays. 
SPOCK: I have already begun investigation into that possibility, Captain. 
SPOCK: I've rechecked the sensors, Captain. Gamma Hydra Four checks out as a Class M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere and normal mass. I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary. 
SPOCK: We're checking it on it. I've reached no conclusions as yet. The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: All research lines negative, Captain. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: I'm doing that, Captain, as per your previous order. We discussed that earlier. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK: (looking about the same as usual) Based on what Doctor McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live. Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in considerably lesser time. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. In a very short time. 
SPOCK: (sitting up) I must differ with you, Doctor. I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing, my eye sight appears to be failing, and the normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold. 
SPOCK: Captain, you sent such a message this morning. 
SPOCK: Captain, I believe (notices, and wakes him gently) Captain. Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. Quite understandable. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. We have the cause of the affliction. 
SPOCK: The orbit of Gamma Hydra Four carried the planet directly through the comet's trail. On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing. On resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared. Below normal radiation levels but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet. 
SPOCK: (consulting PADD) Quadrant four four eight, sir. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, what is our present position? 
SPOCK: Possibly, Doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before. 
SPOCK: I have a question for the doctor. (Kirk leaves) Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me. I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to one hundred twenty five degrees, which is at least tolerable. However, I 
SPOCK: I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold. 
SPOCK: Yes. As I always suspected. (leaves) 
SPOCK: Commodore? 
SPOCK: I am aware of that. 
SPOCK: For what, sir? 
SPOCK: On what grounds, Commodore? 
SPOCK: Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction? 
SPOCK: I'm half human, sir. My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacity is reduced. I tire easily. No, sir. I am not fit for command. 
SPOCK: Sir, I do have duties to perform. 
SPOCK: I resist that suggestion, Commodore. 
SPOCK: Very well, sir. The hearing shall convene at fourteen hundred hours. 
SPOCK: Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself. 
SPOCK: On the contrary, Commodore. As presiding officer and as second in command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine. Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement? 
SPOCK: It is quite impossible, Captain. The regulations are quite specific. You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk? 
SPOCK: To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions? 
SPOCK: Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra Four? 
SPOCK: Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? 
SPOCK: Did he order you to increase orbit? 
SPOCK: Did he not several minutes later repeat that order? 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, please answer the question. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Sulu. Yeoman Atkins, you handed Captain Kirk a fuel consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed. Is that correct? 
SPOCK: Yeoman, you will simply answer the question. 
SPOCK: You guess? 
SPOCK: Thank you, Yeoman. You may leave. Lieutenant Uhura. I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans have broken Code two. Are these your initials which appear at the bottom? 
SPOCK: And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours? 
SPOCK: Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra Four? 
SPOCK: Using Code two. 
SPOCK: After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code two. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Lieutenant. Doctor McCoy, Doctor McCoy! 
SPOCK: Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK: Medical banks, compute described subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK: Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition. 
SPOCK: Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly? 
SPOCK: Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age. Do you agree with it? 
SPOCK: Do you agree with it, Doctor? 
SPOCK: This board has no further questions. Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something that you would like to add. 
SPOCK: Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk? 
SPOCK: Captain, I would suggest 
SPOCK: Gamma Hydra Four, Captain. 
SPOCK: You're inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by our own chief surgeon. All these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental conditions. 
SPOCK: We have no more questions, Captain. 
SPOCK: There'll be no more questions, Captain. If you would leave the room so the board can vote 
SPOCK: Sir, you have never commanded a starship. 
SPOCK: The danger from the Romulans 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'm sorry, Captain. 
SPOCK: Regulations require 
SPOCK: Captain, I have not assumed command. 
SPOCK: I suffer the same affliction as you, sir. 
SPOCK: Commodore Stocker. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott was unfit for command. Commodore Stocker is ranking officer 
SPOCK: I cannot, Captain. 
SPOCK: No, sir. Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship. 
SPOCK: It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use. 
SPOCK: No, not all the time. Captain, he left us for a few moments. 
SPOCK: Yes. Yes, indeed, Captain. Doctor, you remember 
SPOCK: Quite possible, Doctor. Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I made the necessary computations and produced this serum. It is crude and dangerous, but we have no time for refinements. 
SPOCK: It could cure or kill, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Doctor Wallace, give him the shot. 
SPOCK: Romulans giving ground, Captain. Obviously, they tapped in as you expected them to. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: The Romulans were caught off guard, Captain. They're falling behind. 
SPOCK: I am quite ready now, Doctor. 
SPOCK: That is very considerate of you, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Something wrong? 
SPOCK: Perhaps you're making a rather hasty judgment. Mister Norman has only been aboard seventy two hours. 
SPOCK: Specifics, Doctor. Labels do not make arguments. 
SPOCK: I see. 
SPOCK: I find your argument strewn with gaping defects in logic. 
SPOCK: That's not at all surprising, Doctor. He's probably terrified of your beads and rattles. 
SPOCK: Interesting. 
SPOCK: Confirmed, Captain. He's taken out all the override controls. If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is, we could extinguish ourselves. 
SPOCK: And most sophisticated. 
SPOCK: (attempting a mind meld) He simply appears to have turned himself off, Captain. And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship 
SPOCK: Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant. 
SPOCK: He did not pay royalties. 
SPOCK: The guilty party has his choice. Death by electrocution, death by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging. 
SPOCK: You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here. Logically, you must have a compelling motive. 
SPOCK: Then I'm unable to discern your problem. 
SPOCK: Whom do you serve now? 
SPOCK: We are, and we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter. Obviously this many androids cannot operate independently. There must be a central control system which guides the entire android population. 
SPOCK: Very interesting. Very interesting. This is a most unusual device. 
SPOCK: Did I understand there are more than two hundred thousand of you? 
SPOCK: This would seem to be a simple relay centre. Are all of you controlled through this device? 
SPOCK: Oh, that's quite understandable. 
SPOCK: Captain, I've just had a most fascinating meeting with Norman, and I'm convinced I've discovered a very important inconsistency. 
SPOCK: He could successfully accomplish it, Captain. I've questioned a number of the androids, and they're totally loyal to Mudd. Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything a human being could ask for in unlimited quantity. 
SPOCK: Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: I'm curious, Norman. Just how do you intend to stop them? 
SPOCK: Eminently practical. 
SPOCK: Indeed, it is not. They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it. 
SPOCK: Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste. They have only to install some cybernetic devices aboard the Enterprise and they'll be able to leave orbit. 
SPOCK: I asked them. 
SPOCK: Yet the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than two hundred thousand of them. 
SPOCK: There are a large number of Alices and Trudies, Maisies, Annabels, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar series, a whole plethora of series in fact. But only one Norman. 
SPOCK: To function as they do, each android mind must be one component of a mass brain linked through a central locus. 
SPOCK: That would seem logical. 
SPOCK: What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity. 
SPOCK: I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents. 
SPOCK: Of course. Your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension. 
SPOCK: Thank you. 
SPOCK: I love you. However, I hate you. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course. That is exactly why I hate you. Because you are identical. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Success, Captain. We've been pruning the leaves and branches of the tree. Now it is time to get to work on the root. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: Logic is a little tweeting bird chirping in a meadow. Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad. Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are green. 
SPOCK: Very well, Captain. 
SPOCK: I believe that is the correct amount, Captain. Mister Mudd, are you ready? 
SPOCK: Be careful. I would not want you to drop it. 
SPOCK: I believe they are all immobilised, Captain. 
SPOCK: That is a human emotion, Doctor, with which I am totally unfamiliar. How could I be unhappy? 
SPOCK: Which I find eminently satisfactory, Doctor, for nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans. 
SPOCK: The androids are being reprogrammed. Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use. They'll begin that work again. 
SPOCK: Deep Space Station K7 now within sensor range, Captain. 
SPOCK: That is illogical, Ensign. Odours cannot travel through the vacuum of space. 
SPOCK: Extremely little, Ensign. 
SPOCK: Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact. The battle of Donatu Five was fought near here twenty three solar years ago. Inconclusive. 
SPOCK: Undeveloped. Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our Federation and the Klingon Empire. We do have the better claim. 
SPOCK: John Burke was the Chief Astronomer at the Royal Academy in old Britain at the time. 
SPOCK; That gives him the authority. 
SPOCK: Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of wheat and rye. A perennial, also, I believe. Its root grain, triticale, can trace its ancestry all the way back to twentieth century Canada 
SPOCK: Misuse of the Priority One channels is a Federation offence. 
SPOCK: It would seem a logical precaution, Captain. The Sherman's Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation. 
SPOCK: Nevertheless Captain, the Klingons would not enjoy seeing us successfully develop Sherman's Planet. 
SPOCK: But not totally unexpected. 
SPOCK: (stroking a tribble) A most curious creature, Captain. Its trilling seems to have a tranquillising effect on the human nervous system. Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect. 
SPOCK: Captain, may I ask where you'll be? 
SPOCK: There's something disquieting about these creatures. 
SPOCK: Don't be insulting, Doctor. They remind me of the lilies of the field. They toil not, neither do they spin. But they seem to eat a great deal. I see no practical use for them. 
SPOCK: So would an ermine violin, but I see no advantage in having one. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics. I am frequently inundated by them, but I've trained myself to put up with practically anything. 
SPOCK: What is that, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Doctor? 
SPOCK: They do have one redeeming characteristic. 
SPOCK: They do not talk too much. If you'll excuse me, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor. I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction. The figures are taking an alarming direction. They're consuming our supplies and returning nothing. 
SPOCK: Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors. 
SPOCK: By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape. 
SPOCK: He simply could not believe his ears. 
SPOCK: We have already checked on the background of Mister Cyrano Jones. He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector. He's never broken the law, at least not severely. For the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he's obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station. 
SPOCK: They seem to be gorged. 
SPOCK: One million seven hundred seventy one thousand five hundred sixty one. That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average litter of ten, producing a new generation every twelve hours over a period of three days. 
SPOCK: And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment. 
SPOCK: Captain this tribble is dead. And so are these. 
SPOCK: The logical assumption is that there is something in the grain. 
SPOCK: I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon commander would be necessary for that, Mister Baris. 
SPOCK: Remarkable. 
SPOCK: Obviously tribbles are very perceptive creatures, Captain. 
SPOCK: The penalty is twenty years in a rehabilitation colony. 
SPOCK: Seventeen point nine, to be exact. 
SPOCK: He'll do it. 
SPOCK: Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter. 
SPOCK: Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the possibilities of 
SPOCK: Well, it was Mister Scott who performed the actual engineering. 
SPOCK: No doubt about it, Captain. The space debris comes from the survey vessel SS Beagle. 
SPOCK: Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings. Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever. 
SPOCK: It would have come from planet four, star system eight nine two, directly ahead. 
SPOCK: SS Beagle. Small class four stardrive vessel. Crew of forty seven, commanded by. Jim, I believe you knew him. Captain R M Merik. 
SPOCK: Different in shape only, Captain. The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth. Density five point five, diameter seven nine one seven at the equator, atmosphere seventy eight percent nitrogen, twenty one percent oxygen. Again, exactly like Earth. 
SPOCK: I also picked up indications of large cities. 
SPOCK: No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system. 
SPOCK: Television was the colloquial term. 
SPOCK: Captain, the one described as the barbarian is also listed here. Flight officer William B. Harrison of the SS Beagle. At least there were some survivors down there. 
SPOCK: But hardly more practical, captain. Close to the city we located, but not populated. We should not be observed. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your twentieth century. Moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide and partially consumed hydrocarbons. 
SPOCK: Yes, I believe that was the term. I had no idea you were that much of a historian, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Then the Prime Directive is in full force, Captain? 
SPOCK: I fail to see the humour in that situation, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Complete Earth parallel. The language here is English. 
SPOCK: There would seem to be evidence to that effect. 
SPOCK: I call them ears. 
SPOCK: Never. Colloquial twentieth-century English. An amazing parallel. 
SPOCK: Sir, we came here looking for some friends, forty seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago. They wore clothing similar to ours. Have you heard of such men? 
SPOCK: (brings over a magazine) Captain, I thought you might find this interesting. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Captain, a logical question, if I may. Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your first citizen? 
SPOCK: Curious, Captain, the similarity in names. Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy? 
SPOCK: Why, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Even more fascinating. Slavery evolving into an institution with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions. 
SPOCK: Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me. 
SPOCK: Really, Doctor, I had no idea they were trained. Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error. 
SPOCK: Interesting, and given a conservative empire, quite understandable. 
SPOCK: I said I understood it, Doctor. I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating. 
SPOCK: They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Situations quite familiar to the six million who died in your first world war, the eleven million who died in your second, the thirty seven million who died in your third. Shall I go on? 
SPOCK: Quite correct. 
SPOCK: I tell you I'm well able to defeat you. 
SPOCK: I do not want to injure you. 
SPOCK: Need any help, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Such emotions are foreign to me, Doctor. I'm merely testing the strength of the door. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I am seeking a means of escape. Will you please be brief? 
SPOCK: Yes, that's quite true. 
SPOCK: Oh, yes. You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude. You're welcome, I believe, is the correct response. However, Doctor, you must remember I am entirely motivated by logic. The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I think of his skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise and therefore 
SPOCK: Really, Doctor? 
SPOCK: What did they do to you? 
SPOCK: I wish we could have examined that belief of his more closely. It seems illogical for a sun worshiper to develop a philosophy of total brotherhood. Sun worship is usually a primitive superstition religion. 
SPOCK: It will replace their imperial Rome, but it will happen in their twentieth century. 
SPOCK: Vulcan honours us with your presence. We come to serve. 
SPOCK: Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents. 
SPOCK: Humans smile with so little provocation. 
SPOCK: The situation between my father and myself has not changed. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain? 
SPOCK: If you will excuse me, Captain. (leaves) 
SPOCK: Not precisely, Doctor. On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and they have six-inch fangs. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration is unfamiliar. Most unusual. 
SPOCK: Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours. 
SPOCK: Guess, Captain? I shall need more data for my estimate. 
SPOCK: Vessel changing course, heading toward us at high warp speed. 
SPOCK: Interesting. They were travelling at approximately warp ten. 
SPOCK: Vulcans. On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya. It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain? Interesting. 
SPOCK: Vulcans do not approve of violence. 
SPOCK: No, Captain. I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason. 
SPOCK: If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing. Logically and efficiently. 
SPOCK: Mother. If only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull. 
SPOCK: Yes, it could adversely affect our mission. 
SPOCK: Worry is a human emotion, Captain. I accept what has happened. The ship's hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes. It is manned, but sensors cannot make out specifics. 
SPOCK: I think it unlikely it is one of theirs. 
SPOCK: Possibly, Captain. But I cannot decode this transmission. 
SPOCK: It is in no known code. There's no detectable pattern. No standard references apply. 
SPOCK: Only negative. It fits none of our computer records, and it is alien. 
SPOCK: Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect? 
SPOCK: I suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach. 
SPOCK: My blood is T-negative, Doctor. 
SPOCK: It should be possible to filter out the human factors. 
SPOCK: Indeed. I would estimate the odds 
SPOCK: Doctor. 
SPOCK: Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan. 
SPOCK: But it does look promising. 
SPOCK: I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable. 
SPOCK: It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel Five. 
SPOCK: Miss Chapel? I underwent a physical examination last week. Would you pull those records, please? 
SPOCK: It would seem the only answer. 
SPOCK: Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death. And you, Doctor, have no logical alternative either. If you do not operate, Sarek will die. You now have the means to perform the operation. I am volunteering myself as the blood donor. I'll be at my station until you require me. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain? Captain? Captain? 
SPOCK: I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner. 
SPOCK: No, Doctor. 
SPOCK: My first responsibility is to the ship. Our passengers' safety is by Starfleet order of first importance. We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile, vessel. I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances. 
SPOCK: On what grounds, Doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege. I'll be in the brig interrogating the Andorian. 
SPOCK: He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug. He reveals nothing. I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan. 
SPOCK: Apparently Thelev did. 
SPOCK: I do not know. There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain. There is no logic in Gav's murder. 
SPOCK: Come in. 
SPOCK: Mother, when I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified. 
SPOCK: Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances. The circumstances are not normal. We're carrying over one hundred valuable Federation passengers. We're being pursued by an alien ship. We're subject to possible attack. There has been murder and attempted murder on board. I cannot dismiss my duties. 
SPOCK: I know, but this must take precedence. If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would. Sarek understands my reason. 
SPOCK: Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan? 
SPOCK: It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial. We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be. 
SPOCK: Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree, if I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? 
SPOCK: Mother 
SPOCK: I cannot. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, are you quite all right? 
SPOCK: I must see the captain. 
SPOCK: The alien ship. I've just realised that if their power utilisation curve is not the norm, it should be possible to identify them this way. Very important. 
SPOCK: Captain, I believe you'll find the alien 
SPOCK: I think you'll find he's an Orion, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system. 
SPOCK: The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve. It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us. That ship was constructed for a suicide mission. Since they never intended to return to their home base, they could use one hundred percent power on their attacks. The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier. 
SPOCK: That hardly seems likely. 
SPOCK: Emotional, isn't she? 
SPOCK: Indeed? Why did you marry her? 
SPOCK: Doctor, I'll return to my station now. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. I've never seen him look so happy. 
SPOCK: Large prints. The ape-like carnivore in the reports? 
SPOCK: Aside from that, you say it's a Garden of Eden? 
SPOCK: Class M in all respects. Quite Earth-like. 
SPOCK: Bows and arrows, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, look. 
SPOCK: Captain, use of our phasers is expressly forbidden. 
SPOCK: No, Captain. I can travel. 
SPOCK: Nurse. 
SPOCK: Hit me. The pain will help me to consciousness. Hit me.
SPOCK: Blast you, strike me! If I don't regain consciousness soon, it may be too late. Hit me. (she slaps his face) Harder! 
SPOCK: Again. Continue. The pain will help me to consciousness. 
SPOCK: That will be quite enough. Thank you, doctor.&nbsp;
SPOCK: She was doing as I requested, Mister Scott. A Vulcan form of self-healing. 
SPOCK: Thank you, nurse. I'm quite fully recovered. 
SPOCK: Position, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: The Klingons? 
SPOCK: Stand by to signal the captain. 
SPOCK [OC] Spock, Captain. I trust all has gone well. 
SPOCK: An illogical question, Doctor, since obviously you are hearing my voice. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged, Captain. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: I presume you mean they vanished in a manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Have you reversed controls? 
SPOCK: Power surge? 
SPOCK: Recheck your equipment, Mister Scott. I'll scan for them on the planet's surface. Spock out. 
SPOCK: I'm beginning to believe that, Mister Scott. I've conducted two sweeps of the planet's surface. There is no sign of life. 
SPOCK: No, Doctor. Even that would show up on our sensors. 
SPOCK: The only answers are negative. No magnetic storms, no ionic interference, no breakdown in your equipment. 
SPOCK: We shall continue sensor scans, Doctor. At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation. 
SPOCK: True, Doctor. Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination. 
SPOCK: They are not within the confines of this solar system. 
SPOCK: I have never heard of a study being done, but it would be a fascinating project. 
SPOCK: Precisely. 
SPOCK: No. I would say approximately four hundred 
SPOCK: I would welcome a suggestion, Doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look. 
SPOCK: Captain's log, stardate 3259.2. First Officer Spock in command. The Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov have been missing for nearly two hours. Computer probability projections are useless due to insufficient data. 
SPOCK: Interesting. It seems to be an ionisation trail.
SPOCK: Exactly the question I have just fed to the computers, Doctor. And the answer is, nothing known to us would account for it. 
SPOCK: Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I am chasing the Captain, Lieutenant Uhura, and Ensign Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl. This is the only lead we've had. 
SPOCK: Initiate. Warp factor two. 
SPOCK: Projecting back along the path of ionisation, the nearest system is M two four alpha. 
SPOCK: Eleven point six three zero. 
SPOCK: I'm suggesting nothing, Doctor. I am merely pursuing the only logical course available to us. 
SPOCK: We searched the area. 
SPOCK: Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism? 
SPOCK: There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma Two. 
SPOCK: In that case, Doctor, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our present course. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, can we manage anything faster than warp six? 
SPOCK: Doctor, I do not respond to hunches. No transporter malfunction was responsible for the disappearance. They were not within the Gamma system. A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching. No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam. Does that clarify the situation? 
SPOCK: I see. (pause) Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we shall continue on our present course. (conspiratorial whisper) Unless it is your intention to declare a mutiny. 
SPOCK: Agreed. Mister Scott, could you manage warp seven? 
SPOCK: Ensign, warp seven. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the planet, on the lower hemisphere. Humanoid readings. 
SPOCK: There will be no landing force, Doctor. Assuming the captain and the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down a large contingent. 
SPOCK: Interesting. No power source. It may be shielded. 
SPOCK: I shall beam down, Doctor. If I am unable to communicate, a landing party may be necessary. 
SPOCK: Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith. But I welcome your company, Doctor. Mister Scott, you'll be in command. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Our scanner survey was correct, Captain. There it is. Pure tritanium. 
SPOCK: Twenty one point four times as hard, to be exact. 
SPOCK: We won't be able to break it, Captain. I'll phaser off a specimen. 
SPOCK: We're in the growing season in this hemisphere of this planet. There are doubtless many pollen aromas. 
SPOCK: Captain, dikironium exists only in laboratory experiments. 
SPOCK: Rizzo's alive, barely. 
SPOCK: You think you know what it was, Captain? 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Spock here. Ready to leave orbit, Captain. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Spock again, Captain. Those medical supplies are badly needed on planet Theta Seven. They are expecting us to get them there on time. 
SPOCK: Continuing scanning. Still no readings of life forms on the planet. 
SPOCK: You mentioned dikironium, Captain. 
SPOCK: I've scanned for that element, Captain. There's no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere. 
SPOCK: To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change its molecular structure, like gold changing itself to lead or wood changing itself to ivory. 
SPOCK: Chekov, take over on scanner. 
SPOCK: What was the size of the thing you saw, Ensign? 
SPOCK: Composition? 
SPOCK: Captain, scientifically 
SPOCK: I hope I'm not disturbing you, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I need your advice. 
SPOCK: I do not understand your reasoning. 
SPOCK: I do not joke, Doctor. Perhaps I should rephrase my statement. I require an opinion. There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend. obsession, for one. The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea. 
SPOCK: Precisely. Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut? 
SPOCK: Fortunately, I read somewhat faster. In brief, Doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated. The captain's name was Garrovick. 
SPOCK: His father. Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment, James T. Kirk. And there is still more. I suggest you study this.
SPOCK: Correctly phrased, Captain. As recommended in the manual. Our reply, also as recommended, is, sir, we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items, which, on the surface, seem unusual. We respectfully ask permission to inquire further 
SPOCK: Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point. It carries perishable drugs 
SPOCK: Creature, Captain? 
SPOCK: You say you could sense its intelligence, Captain? How did it communicate with you? 
SPOCK: Obviously, Captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel, it could pose a great threat to inhabited planets. 
SPOCK: We are barely closing in on it, Captain. We could be pursuing it for days. 
SPOCK: Conflicting data, Captain. It seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy. Elements of both. It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion. 
SPOCK: Extremely efficient, Captain. Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter. 
SPOCK: The deflectors will not stop it, Captain. 
SPOCK: I should have surmised this. For the creature to be able to use gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity. 
SPOCK: May I suggest that we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature. The matter has now been rendered academic. The creature is now after us. 
SPOCK: It turned and attacked, Doctor. Its method was well-considered and intelligent. 
SPOCK: Impossible to tell, Captain, until I can make a closer survey of the creature. 
SPOCK: Captain, the creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits. There is therefore no basis for your self-recrimination. If you had fired on time and on target eleven years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago. Captain Garrovick would still be dead. The fault was not yours, Jim. In fact, there was no fault. 
SPOCK: Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part? (a nod) I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is an hereditary trait of your species. When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, the human will experience a split second of indecision. He hesitates. Do I have your attention, Ensign? 
SPOCK: I know you would prefer to wallow in emotion rather than 
SPOCK: Kindness, Mr. Garrovick, is another human emotion, and I believe we have enough of that. I simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in physio. (suddenly stops and sniffs) Do you smell something? 
SPOCK: Get out of here! I'll attempt to seal it off. 
SPOCK: Fortunately, neither of us is dead, Ensign. The reverse pressure worked. The vent is closed. 
SPOCK: My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron. 
SPOCK: Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct. 
SPOCK: Do you believe you're in communication with the creature? 
SPOCK: It was bearing one two seven mark nine, but I've lost it now. 
SPOCK: It has changed course before to mislead us, Captain. Logic would dictate that 
SPOCK: I do not understand, Captain. 
SPOCK: And you know where home is, Captain? 
SPOCK: Precisely. 
SPOCK: Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn. If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, but thousands. 
SPOCK: An ounce should be sufficient. We can drain it from the ship's engines and transport it to the planet surface in a magnetic vacuum field. 
SPOCK: There is still one problem, Captain. 
SPOCK: Exactly. A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere. If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves 
SPOCK: Also, we cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions. If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him. 
SPOCK: Captain, there is so little hemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively. It therefore seems logical for me to be the one 
SPOCK: It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK: Spock here, Captain. Holding at thirty thousand kilometres. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Reset. Energise. 
SPOCK: We are, Doctor. Cross-circuiting to A. 
SPOCK: Cross-circuiting to B. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, there was no deity involved. It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them. 
SPOCK: Interesting. No indications of magnetic storms in this sector. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Intrepid. It just died. And the four hundred Vulcans aboard, all dead. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I know what I know. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: I assure you, Doctor, I am quite all right. The pain was momentary. It passed quickly. 
SPOCK: I sensed it die. 
SPOCK: Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of four hundred Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us. 
SPOCK: Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know not a person, not even the computers on board the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known. 
SPOCK: I've noticed that about your people, Doctor. You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million. You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours. 
SPOCK: It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody. 
SPOCK: Indications of energy turbulence ahead. Unable to analyse. I've never encountered readings like this before. 
SPOCK: I would assume that. 
SPOCK: Not very likely, Ensign. 
SPOCK: Still not able to analyse, Captain. Sensors are feeding data to the computers now. Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma Seven-A system. 
SPOCK: I have none, Captain. Insufficient data. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: No analysis due to insufficient information. 
SPOCK: I am well aware of that, Captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon. It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant. 
SPOCK: It is not liquid, gaseous, or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it. 
SPOCK: It is not a galactic nebula such as the Coal Sack, and since our deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify. 
SPOCK: Very possible. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Analysing now, Captain. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. All systems functioning properly. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. 
SPOCK: That sound was turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unknown. 
SPOCK: Between where we were and where we are. 
SPOCK: It would never occur to me, Captain. 
SPOCK: We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes. As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK: Sir, we are accelerating. We are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. I suggest you order Mister Scott to give us reverse power. 
SPOCK: In that case, Captain, I would suggest we apply forward thrust. 
SPOCK: It's logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy whether mechanically or biologically produced. Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the Intrepid. 
SPOCK: I would say not, Captain. The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound, but it is not the source of the power drain. 
SPOCK: I submit, Mister Scott, if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous. It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed. 
SPOCK: True. It is also true they never knew what was killing them. Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed. 
SPOCK: Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror. I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it. 
SPOCK: The touch of death. 
SPOCK: Astonishment. 
SPOCK: I cannot say what it is, Captain, but I would say it has found us. 
SPOCK: Getting very confused readings, Captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain. 
SPOCK: Probe will impact in seven point three seconds. 
SPOCK: Readings coming in now, Captain. Length, approximately eleven thousand miles. Width varying from two thousand to three thousand miles. Outer layer studded with space debris and waste. Interior consists of protoplasm, varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi-fluid central mass. Condition, living. 
SPOCK: That is what is drawing us toward it, Captain. The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death. 
SPOCK: Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us. I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus. 
SPOCK: The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry. We are not safe, Captain. We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did. 
SPOCK: I must differ with you, Captain. We have sent unmanned probes into it. They have given us some information but they have not told us what we need to know, and we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it. 
SPOCK: The thing evidently has reflexes. The unmanned probe we sent in must have stung it when it entered. The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction. 
SPOCK: You have a martyr complex, Doctor. I submit that it disqualifies you. 
SPOCK: The Vulcans saw it first and died. 
SPOCK: I am more capable. 
SPOCK: Which makes you indispensable, Captain. Further, you are not a science specialist. 
SPOCK: We don't have one day, Doctor. We have precisely one hour and thirty five minutes of power left. 
SPOCK: Captain, I 
SPOCK: Do not suffer so, Doctor. This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials. 
SPOCK: I am familiar with the equipment, Doctor. We're wasting time. The shuttlecraft is ready. 
SPOCK: This is not a competition, Doctor. Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity. 
SPOCK: Then employ one of your own superstitions. Wish me luck. 
SPOCK [OC]: Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Power drain is enormous and growing worse. 
SPOCK [OC]: Diverting all secondary power to the shields. (McCoy enters) I'll continue communications as long as there is power to transmit. 
SPOCK [OC]: I heard, Captain. 
SPOCK: We discussed that possibility earlier. But you will need this information. 
SPOCK: Slowing now. Contact in eighteen point three seconds. Brace yourselves. The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive. Contact 
SPOCK [OC]: In six seconds. 
SPOCK [OC]: I am undamaged, Captain. Relay to Mister Scott I had three percent power reserve before the shields stabilised. 
SPOCK: There was nothing to spare. I shall continue my tests. Oh, and Doctor McCoy. You would have not survived it. 
SPOCK: I am moving slowly now, establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus. 
SPOCK: Calculations indicate the shields will last only forty seven minutes. 
SPOCK [OC]: However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure. 
SPOCK: Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence. 
SPOCK [OC]: I'm having difficulty maintaining ship control. 
SPOCK [OC]: I'm losing voice contact I will transmit internal co-ordinates of chromosome bodies. 
SPOCK [OC]: This is Spock. 
SPOCK: I am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies. According to my calculations 
SPOCK [OC]: (Barely audible over static) The nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane. Relatively insensitive to interior irritation. I believe sufficient charge of (inaudible) could destroy the organism. Tell Doctor McCoy he should have wished me luck. 
SPOCK: Personal log, Commander Spock, USS Enterprise. I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it. If this record should survive me, I wish it known that I bequeath my highest commendation and testimonial to the captain, officers, and crew of the Enterprise. The finest starship in the fleet. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt. 
SPOCK: Do not risk the ship further on my behalf. 
SPOCK: Why, thank you, Captain McCoy. 
SPOCK: Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Shuttlecraft to Enterprise. Request permission to come aboard. 
SPOCK: Obviously, Captain. And I have some fascinating data on the organism. 
SPOCK: It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination. 
SPOCK: Horizon reports indicate the Iotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative. 
SPOCK: The damage has been done, Doctor. We are here to repair it. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Interesting, Captain. Passers-by are carrying, I believe, firearms. 
SPOCK: Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please? 
SPOCK: Sir, does everyone here carry firearms? 
SPOCK: Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask. 
SPOCK: Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako? 
SPOCK: Captain? Gangsters. Chicago. Mobs. Published in 1992. Where'd you get this? 
SPOCK: This is the contamination, Captain. Astonishing. An entire culture based on this. 
SPOCK: Fascinating, but quite impossible. 
SPOCK: They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society. 
SPOCK: We may quarrel with Mister Oxmyx' methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one. This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it. 
SPOCK: I'm familiar with the culture on Beta Antares. There aren't games 
SPOCK: I have never computed them, Captain. 
SPOCK: Surely, you're coming, Captain. 
SPOCK: Very simple. Amplitude modulation transmission. I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Let me see. (throws a few more switches and picks up the microphone.) Enterprise, this is Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: A very long and complicated story, Lieutenant. Notify the transporter room, Two to beam up, these co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: Futile, Doctor. No specifics. There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion. 
SPOCK: No, Doctor. I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way out of our current dilemma. 
SPOCK: On audio, Lieutenant. Mister Oxmyx, this is Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Irrelevant, since we are here. 
SPOCK: Why would he put a bag on our captain? 
SPOCK: If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mister Oxmyx. 
SPOCK: You'll show no further hostility? 
SPOCK: Since we must have our captain back, I accept. 
SPOCK [OC]: We shall arrive in your office within ten minutes. Spock out. 
SPOCK: If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, Doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous. We are therefore forced to trust Mister Oxmyx. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, though we hope to avoid interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position. 
SPOCK: I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared. Energise. 
SPOCK: Mister Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce. 
SPOCK: Sir, you are employing a double negative. 
SPOCK: I fail to see why you do not understand us. You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet. We agree. 
SPOCK: Co-operation, sir, would inevitably result 
SPOCK: We did, Captain. The situation required our return. 
SPOCK: Nothing useful. Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here. 
SPOCK: To deny the facts would be illogical, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I'm not sanguine about hunches, Captain, but I have no practical alternative. 
SPOCK: A fliwer, Captain. 
SPOCK: Interesting. 
SPOCK: Yes. Oh. I believe they had a device known as a clutch. Clutch, Captain. Perhaps one of those pedals on the floor. 
SPOCK: Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver you leave much to be desired. 
SPOCK: If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render them harmless with reasonable rapidity. 
SPOCK: I beg your pardon? 
SPOCK: Young man 
SPOCK: Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous. 
SPOCK: You do not even know what the action is going to be. 
SPOCK: Logical. 
SPOCK: Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says. I just heard the sound of 
SPOCK: Unquestionably. 
SPOCK: Right. 
SPOCK: A miniscule. A very small piece. 
SPOCK: Right. 
SPOCK: Check. 
SPOCK: Must we? 
SPOCK: But not as safe. 
SPOCK: Not at all, Captain. It's your driving that alarms me. 
SPOCK: I would advise you to keep dialing, Oxmyx. 
SPOCK: Brooding, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, I'm neither brooding nor sombre. But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the Iotians. 
SPOCK: Highly irregular, to say the least, Captain. I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut. 
SPOCK: Captain. If the Iotians, who are very bright and imitative people, should take that communicator apart 
SPOCK: The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment that we have. 
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? 
SPOCK: Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you. 
SPOCK: Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy. 
SPOCK: Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters. 
SPOCK: You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard. 
SPOCK: About your double, Captain. 
SPOCK: We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. 
SPOCK: How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you? 
SPOCK: The search parties, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew. You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you do, they lose faith, and you lose command. 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain. 
SPOCK: About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked. 
SPOCK: Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Continue the search. 
SPOCK: Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search? 
SPOCK: Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, you ordered me to tell you. 
SPOCK: Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision. 
SPOCK: Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness. 
SPOCK: Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. 
SPOCK: If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. 
SPOCK: If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am. 
SPOCK: This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer. 
SPOCK: We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain. 
SPOCK: It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. (sedates it) 
SPOCK: Energise. Reverse. 
SPOCK: The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him. 
SPOCK: For once, I agree with you. 
SPOCK: No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. 
SPOCK: It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear. 
SPOCK: Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? 
SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left? 
SPOCK: Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well. 
SPOCK: Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, I thought the plan 
SPOCK: We'll let the captain handle this. 
SPOCK: You'll have to hold on to him, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain. 
SPOCK: Ready. (beams them out) 
SPOCK: Right away, Captain. 
SPOCK: All sections report ready, sir. 
SPOCK: Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? 
SPOCK: The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman? 
SPOCK: No life form readings, Captain. Continuing scan. 
SPOCK: I am getting readings on small metallic objects, Captain. It is possible the ship was destroyed in space and the survivors proceeded here in a shuttle craft. 
SPOCK: Confirmed. 
SPOCK: Interesting. A neural field? 
SPOCK: What brings you here? 
SPOCK: Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy? 
SPOCK: Fascinating material. Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense. I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure. 
SPOCK: No, Doctor. More than that. They registered as perfect human life forms. I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses. Most curious. 
SPOCK: The chances are very much against it. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I'm constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like. 
SPOCK: Possible. I would have to have one to examine. 
SPOCK: Yes, I recall, Captain. I led him to believe we had escaped. 
SPOCK: I shall attempt it. 
SPOCK: Yes, I will be all right, Captain. We must hurry. 
SPOCK: Yes, quite all right, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I did not break it, Doctor. I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before. 
SPOCK: A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness. Colours, shapes, mathematical equations fused and blurred. I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far I've been able to recall clearly only one. Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles. Minds of such control and capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function. 
SPOCK: Undoubtedly. 
SPOCK: I'm dubious of the possibilities of success, Captain. The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power. The polarized elements would burn out quickly. 
SPOCK: A small one. 
SPOCK: I assure you, Captain, I am in perfect health. 
SPOCK: We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation. 
SPOCK: It will take me a moment to prepare. 
SPOCK: I've located their power source, captain. It's installed in Engineering. 
SPOCK: Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible. 
SPOCK: This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet. Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons. We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine. 
SPOCK: There is one other possibility, Mister Scott. The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him. The Enterprise is propelled by matter-anti-matter reactors. The barrier we must traverse is negative energy. 
SPOCK: Nor I. But it must be made available to the captain. 
SPOCK: Impossible, Captain. The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach even with our phasers. Mister Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us. 
SPOCK: The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy. 
SPOCK: When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode. The Kelvans will be stopped here. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative. (Kirk starts chewing his nails with indecision) All instruments off the dials, Captain. We are in contact with the barrier.&nbsp;
SPOCK: Instruments returning to normal, Captain. 
SPOCK: Life support systems sustaining on emergency. 
SPOCK: I have reviewed ship's personnel, Captain. It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Most curious. 
SPOCK: The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness. The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity. To achieve it, they have apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them. Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions. 
SPOCK: Yes. Quite correct, Captain. But they have taken human form and are therefore having human reaction. 
SPOCK: That seems reasonable. 
SPOCK: Yes. Humans are very peculiar. I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study.&nbsp;
SPOCK: I believe you're referring to a kiss. But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other. 
SPOCK: Your game is off. Are you disturbed by the incident? 
SPOCK: You've known Kelinda for some time. She's a Kelvan as you are. Among humans, I've found the symptoms you're displaying usually indicate jealousy. 
SPOCK: Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive. 
SPOCK: You are not jealous? 
SPOCK: Nor upset? 
SPOCK: Checkmate. 
SPOCK: Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I'm due for another injection of stokaline. 
SPOCK: Stokaline. 
SPOCK: Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments. 
SPOCK: If you wish, I shall call him to the bridge. 
SPOCK: I left him in the recreation room. 
SPOCK: No, Kelinda was with him. She seemed anxious to speak to him. 
SPOCK: It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her. Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more. 
SPOCK: Rojan, you are only a link in a chain, following an order given three hundred years ago. This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own. 
SPOCK: A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal. 
SPOCK: Someone or something is attempting to attract our attention. 
SPOCK: I do not know. Not even a Vulcan can know the unknown, Captain. We are hundreds of light years past where any Earth ship has ever explored. 
SPOCK: Class M planet, Captain. 
SPOCK: With two very important exceptions. It's much older than Earth, and about a half million years ago, its atmosphere was totally ripped away by some sort of cataclysm. The planet has evidently been dead since then. Sensors detect no life of any kind. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet. 
SPOCK: Reading energy only, Captain. No life forms. 
SPOCK: Coming from deep under the planet's surface, Captain. Under at least one hundred miles of solid rock. 
SPOCK: Reading a chamber now. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support. 
SPOCK: Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Evidently, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unlikely. These co-ordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber. 
SPOCK: I'm sure she did, Captain, Just as you received an order to bring me along. 
SPOCK: Approximately one hundred twelve point three seven miles, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Captain, the security guards. 
SPOCK: This vault was constructed about a half a million years ago. About the same time the planet surface was destroyed, if our sensor readings are accurate. 
SPOCK: They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me. Much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before. 
SPOCK: Sargon, would it harm you if I 
SPOCK: Pure energy. Matter without form. 
SPOCK: That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan prehistory. 
SPOCK: Just a moment, Doctor. 
SPOCK: And if he refuses, Doctor, what do you propose to do with your phaser? That is still Jim's body. 
SPOCK: What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish? 
SPOCK: Doctor? 
SPOCK: What is it you want of us? 
SPOCK: When the struggle came which devastated your planet 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: These others, they were stored differently than you, but it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there KIRK: and search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing. And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here. 
SPOCK: Our bodies, Sargon, for what purpose? 
SPOCK: Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us. 
SPOCK: Captain, do you know what happened? Do you remember any part of it? 
SPOCK: Once inside their mechanical bodies, engineer, they can leave this planet, travel back with us. With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead ten thousand years. 
SPOCK: No, he's not. 
SPOCK: (with a grin and echoy voice) Hello. Oh, you are a lovely female. A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years. 
SPOCK: You're welcome. 
SPOCK: This is an excellent body, Doctor. I seem to have received the best of the three. Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms. I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course, Just as we do, Doctor. 
SPOCK: It will be unnecessary, Doctor. This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism. 
SPOCK: I'll prepare the formula, Sargon. 
SPOCK: I can continue in this body for several hours. 
SPOCK: This woman will assist me. (to Chapel) You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory. 
SPOCK: Now. this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal. While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of ten cc's each hour. 
SPOCK: This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa. And this one you will code mark for me. 
SPOCK: This one you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body. 
SPOCK: No, that's correct. But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice. 
SPOCK: What were you saying? 
SPOCK: Yes. Well, you were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos. 
SPOCK: Very good. You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this body. It is therefore necessary for you to kill your captain so that Sargon will die with him. 
SPOCK: In two days, you'll have your own hands, Thalassa. Mechanically efficient and quite human-looking. Android robot hands, of course. Hands without feeling. Enjoy the taste of life while you can. 
SPOCK: It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, engineer, and will last a thousand years. That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it. 
SPOCK: A thousand-year prison, Thalassa. And when it wears out we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years. And another, and another. Sargon has closed his mind to a better way. With these bodies. 
SPOCK: When you awoke in this body, Thalassa, you said how good it was to breathe again, to have eyes and to see again. To feel. To live and feel again, Thalassa. Just think how much we can do for mankind. Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this? 
SPOCK: This is your new home, Thalassa. Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing. You no doubt want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman. (he tests its hand movement.) It is ready, Thalassa. 
SPOCK: You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer. Sargon would've required that you enter the mechanism immediately. 
SPOCK: Must I make an example of you, too, Helm? 
SPOCK: Pain, Captain. And you, my dear? 
SPOCK: Fortunately, Doctor, I know every thought of every mind around me. See? (to Chapel) Take the hypo from him. And inject him with it. 
SPOCK: Fools. I'll simply transfer to another place, another body. 
SPOCK: Sargon! No, Sargon, please. Let me. Let me transfer. 
SPOCK: It seems, Doctor, the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness. 
SPOCK: The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain. 
SPOCK: Passing outer planet, Zeon. 
SPOCK: I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared. 
SPOCK: What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events. 
SPOCK: Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship. Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability. Reaction powered. A small rocket. It is on an intercept course. That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have. 
SPOCK: Captain, it's an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. A thermonuclear warhead. 
SPOCK: Most interesting. We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon. 
SPOCK: According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy. The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful. 
SPOCK: Ready, Captain. 
SPOCK: The Ekosians are humanoid, so there is apt to be a similarity in architecture. Interesting. 
SPOCK: Captain, the non-interference Directive. 
SPOCK: Mid-twentieth century Earth. The nation state called Nazi Germany. 
SPOCK: Virtually impossible, Captain, yet the evidence is quite clear. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, Captain? 
SPOCK: That's very well taken, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes. Obviously he's not one of us. I captured him. Is that not correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland? 
SPOCK: Take charge of him. 
SPOCK: Your uniform, Captain. 
SPOCK: Quite correct. You should make a very convincing Nazi. 
SPOCK: Yes. I shall tend to it, Major. 
SPOCK: Obviously. 
SPOCK: Why do the Nazis hate Zeons? 
SPOCK: Is Zeon a threat to them? 
SPOCK: It would seem the assumption was premature. 
SPOCK: That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival. 
SPOCK: Captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door, and the guard beyond it. To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy. 
SPOCK: Yes. 
SPOCK: Of course. The rubindium crystals in the transponders. 
SPOCK: Yes. We must hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance, which I believe should be twenty seven point two millimetres. 
SPOCK: Twenty seven point two millimetres would be, approximately, there. That is, of course, a crude estimation. 
SPOCK: Yes. To reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform. 
SPOCK: Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve the necessary stimulus. As I recall from the history of physics, the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation, even using crude natural crystals. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course, Captain. You realise that the aim will of course be very crude. 
SPOCK: Captain, why should I aim at such a structure? 
SPOCK: May I remind you, we did not intend to fight. 
SPOCK: Possibly. 
SPOCK: I do not see them. 
SPOCK: Captain, without phasers, and until we are able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet. 
SPOCK: Captain, I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators. May I work undisturbed somewhere? 
SPOCK: By using parts from both, I've completed one communicator. I do not know if the circuits are correct, Captain. There is no way to test it, except in actual use. 
SPOCK: The one receiving a medal. 
SPOCK: This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland. We saw her being decorated. 
SPOCK: That is correct. 
SPOCK: As an honoured member of the Party, she could get us past the guards. 
SPOCK: Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you Earthmen enjoy gambling. No matter how carefully one computes the odds of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk. 
SPOCK; I hope not. 
SPOCK: Captain, it was John Gill, but he never moved. Never once looked up. 
SPOCK: Or a deep psychosis. 
SPOCK: It may not have the range it had. In fact, it may not work at all. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. Come in, Enterprise. 
SPOCK: If there's going to be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our 
SPOCK: There is a logical way to proceed, Doctor. Point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push. We have no time for emotionalism. 
SPOCK: Yes. A doctor should have more pride. 
SPOCK: Captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us. 
SPOCK: True. I shall reconsider. 
SPOCK: Captain, the speech follows no logical pattern. 
SPOCK: What drug? 
SPOCK: Captain. I have created a condition in which Gill cannot initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions. 
SPOCK: Quite correct. For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon. 
SPOCK: Quite true, Captain. That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination. 
SPOCK: Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could accomplish its efficiency without sadism. 
SPOCK: Is he dead, Captain? 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation. 
SPOCK: Captain, I never will understand humans. How could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's, have made such a fatal error? 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. I was able to gather the meaning. 
SPOCK: Yes. Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan. Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power. 
SPOCK: Obviously, Doctor, you fail to accept 
SPOCK: Commodore Wesley. How do you do, sir? 
SPOCK: The most ambitious computer complex ever created. Its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship, to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control. 
SPOCK: I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, Commodore. I'm well acquainted with Doctor Daystrom's theories and discoveries. The basic design of all our ship's computers are Doctor Daystrom's. 
SPOCK: We are attempting to prove it can run this ship more efficiently than man. 
SPOCK: The most unfortunate lack in current computer programming is that there is nothing available to immediately replace the starship surgeon. 
SPOCK: I am honoured, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Fascinating, Doctor. This computer has a potential beyond anything you've ever done. Even your breakthrough in duotronics did not have the promise of this. 
SPOCK: The M-5 has been perfected, Commander. Its potential is a fact. 
SPOCK: If I can be of assistance, Doctor. 
SPOCK: M-5 has performed admirably so far. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am forced to agree with Doctor Daystrom. With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator. In fact, it might have been a further demonstration of M-5's capability. 
SPOCK: Enjoy, Captain? No. I'm merely gratified to see Doctor Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner. M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career. 
SPOCK: The planet is class M, Captain. Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support. Two major land masses, a number of islands, life form readings. 
SPOCK: (handing over a computer disc) M-5's readout, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, the computer does not judge. It makes logical selections. 
SPOCK: I am not familiar with these instruments, Doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism. However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before. 
SPOCK: Doctor, this unit is not a human body. The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it. 
SPOCK: Captain, sensors report two contacts now. One on the port bow, one on the stern. Distance, two hundred thousand kilometres and closing. 
SPOCK: We are not scheduled for war games in this area. This may be a surprise attack as a problem for the M-5. 
SPOCK: Phaser hit on port deflector four, Captain. 
SPOCK: Attacking vessels are moving off. 
SPOCK: Minor hit on deflector screen four. No appreciable damage. 
SPOCK: The ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvred her. Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control. 
SPOCK: Practical, Captain? Perhaps. But not desirable. Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them. Captain the starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it, or him. 
SPOCK: Dunsel, Doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy. It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose. 
SPOCK [OC]: Another contact, Captain. A large, slow-moving vessel. 
SPOCK: Unidentified. This is not a drill. 
SPOCK: M-5 has identified her, Captain. The Woden. Listed in Starfleet Registry as an old-style ore freighter converted to automation. No crew. Coming into visual range. 
SPOCK: No effect on any of the M-5 controls, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target. Full power. 
SPOCK: All systems report normal, Captain. 
SPOCK: I would say, Captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself. 
SPOCK: M-5 appears drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter-antimatter reserves. 
SPOCK: The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines. The computer now controls all helm, navigation, and engineering functions. 
SPOCK: There is one possibility. The automatic helm navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from engineering level three. 
SPOCK: Most illogical. Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform. Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically. 
SPOCK: No. But it is interesting. 
SPOCK: Good. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock to Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK [OC]: We are ready, Captain. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter. As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control. 
SPOCK: Manual override is in control, Captain. 
SPOCK: Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK [OC]: Examine the H two seven nine elements, also the G nine five systems. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Ensign. 
SPOCK: It appears, Captain, we've been doing what used to be called pursuing a wild goose. M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system. 
SPOCK: I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals. 
SPOCK: I do not know. It is not performing in a logical manner. 
SPOCK: I do not mean to offend, sir, but it behaves with an almost human pattern. 
SPOCK: Attack force closing rapidly, breaking formation, attacking at will. 
SPOCK: Hit on the Lexington. 
SPOCK: Hit in engineering section. Possible damage to her impulse engines. She's still maneuverable on warp drive. 
SPOCK: The Excalibur, a direct hit. 
SPOCK: Lexington hit again. 
SPOCK: Probably true, Captain. It works faster, thinks faster than we do. It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer. 
SPOCK: Doctor Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5 circuits. 
SPOCK: Then perhaps you could talk to the unit. M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it. 
SPOCK: I am most impressed with the technology, Captain. Doctor Daystrom has created a mirror image of his mind. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Every living thing wants to survive, Captain. Daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer. 
SPOCK: Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander. I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death. 
SPOCK: Captain, attack force almost within phaser range. 
SPOCK: M-5 is leaving itself open to attack. The machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock to Captain. 
SPOCK: The force field is gone, Captain. M-5 is neutralised. 
SPOCK: I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition. 
SPOCK: Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set. 
SPOCK: No, Doctor. I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better. 
SPOCK: I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question. 
SPOCK: It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer, Doctor. The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining. 
SPOCK: We're locked onto the Exeter's engineering section, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: As if they were in them when 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Galloway and I are checking out the lower levels. There seems to be no one aboard. Only uniforms. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Aye, sir. 
SPOCK: I have their surgeon's log, Captain. Their last log entry, Captain, on screen. 
SPOCK: Interesting that the villagers know about phasers. 
SPOCK: A Yang lance, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Bruised only. We were approximately one hundred metres from the village when five of the savages ambushed us. We managed to escape without firing. 
SPOCK: Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements. One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death. They seem incredibly vicious. Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing for an attack. There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills beyond. However, he was less than truthful in one very important matter. 
SPOCK: Captain Tracey's reserve belt packs. Empty. Found among the remains of several hundred Yang bodies. 
SPOCK: A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser. I have found villagers who will corroborate it. 
SPOCK: Regulations are quite harsh, but they're also quite clear, Captain. If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty. 
SPOCK: I agree that formal charges have little meaning now. However, you must at least confiscate his phaser. 
SPOCK: Not that I have observed, Captain. Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied. 
SPOCK: Good, Captain. Try to reason with them. Keep trying, Captain. Their behaviour is highly illogical. 
SPOCK: I have tried, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, I have managed to loosen this grill somewhat. If the mortar on yours is as old. 
SPOCK: Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here. The only reasonable explanation would be a war. Nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust. 
SPOCK: Yes, I heard, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain? Captain? Captain, are you able to respond? 
SPOCK: Seven hours and eight minutes, Captain. 
SPOCK: We can contact the ship in a few moments, Captain, if I can cross-circuit this unit. 
SPOCK: War created an imbalance and nature counterbalanced it. 
SPOCK: Ready, Captain. Quite crude. Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship. 
SPOCK: I'm weak, Captain, but not in difficulty. 
SPOCK: My need for attention is vital, Doctor, but our need for departure is even more immediate. 
SPOCK: Yes. I see, Captain. They would've learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance. 
SPOCK: Kohms? Communists? The parallel is almost too close, Captain. It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided, and in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet. 
SPOCK: I am open to suggestions, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I'm making a suggestion. 
SPOCK: There's no question about his guilt, Captain, but does our involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive? 
SPOCK [OC]: Transporter room to Captain. 
SPOCK: It appears we have accidentally intercepted someone's transporter beam, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: It's incredibly powerful. 
SPOCK: Captain, something is beaming aboard this vessel. 
SPOCK: The beam is originating at least one thousand light years away. 
SPOCK: If what he says is true, Captain, every second we delay him could be dangerous. 
SPOCK: A most difficult decision, Captain. 
SPOCK: Quite a lovely animal, Captain. I find myself strangely drawn to it. 
SPOCK: He did say his planet was hidden, Captain. 
SPOCK: Current Earth crises would fill a tape bank, Captain. There will be an important assassination today, an equally dangerous government coup in Asia, and, this could be highly critical, the launching of an orbital nuclear warhead platform by the United States countering a similar launch by other powers. 
SPOCK: Most definitely. Once the sky was full of orbiting H-bombs, the slightest mistake could have brought one down by accident, setting off a nuclear holocaust. 
SPOCK: He might be inclined to prepare a perfect one, Captain. But then again he may be telling the truth. 
SPOCK: Following him down is a major risk, Captain. If we ourselves do anything that changes history 
SPOCK: In here, Captain. (at door to main room) 
SPOCK: Chances are he's out of sight inside the rocket gantry or at one of the control centres. 
SPOCK: Here, let me help you, Sergeant. It's operated with this dial here. 
SPOCK: I can try, Captain. 
SPOCK: I can estimate some of this, Captain, but without more time 
SPOCK: It is difficult to know which is best, Captain. 
SPOCK: Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically. You must rely on your human intuition. 
SPOCK: Correction, Mister Seven. It appears we did not interfere. The Enterprise was part of what was supposed to happen on this day in 1968. 
SPOCK: And you'll be pleased our records show that it resulted in a new and stronger international agreement against the use of such weapons. 
SPOCK: Captain, we could say that Mister Seven and Miss Lincoln have some interesting experiences in store for them. 
SPOCK: Live long and prosper, Mister Seven. 
SPOCK: On mark eight and closing. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: A mechanical device of unknown properties. I read no life forms aboard. 
SPOCK: Obviously, it intends to intercept us. It has made several course changes corresponding with our own. 
SPOCK: Unclear whether it intends to attack or merely communicate with us. 
SPOCK: Indeed. 
SPOCK: Vulcan, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unquestionably. Most impressive. 
SPOCK: True telepaths can be most formidable, and we have been warned. 
SPOCK: No recorded contacts. If they ever ventured into space, they evidently withdrew immediately. 
SPOCK: I prefer being a welcomed guest, Captain, but there seems to be little choice. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. Sensor readings give no indication of fog like conditions in this area. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. Unlike Mister Scott's transporter, this unit is not functioning. 
SPOCK: No use, Captain. Obviously none of our devices will function. Apparently that Melkotian buoy 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Obviously this represents the Melkotian's concept of an American frontier town, circa 1880. 
SPOCK: Perhaps the Melkotians have insufficient data about this era. 
SPOCK: Crude but dangerous. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Melkot said you were the pattern. He looked into your mind and selected what he considered the proper time and place for our punishment. 
SPOCK: Yes. The violence of your own heritage is to be the pattern for our execution. 
SPOCK: Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us. 
SPOCK: Are they really? 
SPOCK: Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history. The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of America. the United States of America, that is. 
SPOCK: And the Clanton gang. On October 26th, they had it out. 
SPOCK: History cannot be changed. 
SPOCK: Is this a dead man, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately. Without moving a muscle of either hand. If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw. It initiated unfortunate events. 
SPOCK: I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK: I assure you, sir, we shall watch it, and everything, extremely closely. 
SPOCK: The day is still young, Ensign. 
SPOCK: And if this is indeed some sort of replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the OK Corral at five o'clock this afternoon. 
SPOCK: Impossible, Captain. In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours. 
SPOCK: Mister Chekov is involved, Captain. 
SPOCK: It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town. 
SPOCK: There's no way we can know where it is, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I could make a device to deliver it on target. 
SPOCK: I shall need some fusing and cotton wadding. 
SPOCK: I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade. 
SPOCK: And it is not yet our time. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us. Specifically, our future. 
SPOCK: I understand the feeling, Captain. 
SPOCK: My feelings are not a subject for discussion, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Captain, it's quite all right. They forget I am half human. 
SPOCK: Captain. I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused. 
SPOCK: Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang. You, Ike Clanton, I, Frank McLowery, then Mister Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not? 
SPOCK: But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the OK Corral? 
SPOCK: Mister Chekov is dead. But in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived. 
SPOCK: Another hour. 
SPOCK: Not precisely. 
SPOCK: It should. 
SPOCK: Negotiating with them could buy us more time, Captain. 
SPOCK: It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device. Then perhaps we could quiet things down. 
SPOCK: These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well. 
SPOCK: Perhaps they would've been if they'd had your ingenuity, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Right now. 
SPOCK: It has not been tested. 
SPOCK: But this is painless. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Captain, you don't seem to understand. It did not function, but it must function. 
SPOCK: A scientific fact But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order. 
SPOCK: That may not be necessary. 
SPOCK: A fact, Captain. Physical laws simply cannot be ignored. Existence cannot be without them. 
SPOCK: I mean, Doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction. The tranquilliser you created should have been effective. 
SPOCK: Exactly. Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mister Chekov? 
SPOCK: Wrong. His mind killed him. 
SPOCK: Physical reality is consistent with universal laws. Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality. All of this is unreal. 
SPOCK: But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust. We judge reality by the response of our senses. Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules. We judged the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real, therefore they can kill. 
SPOCK: He may indeed be dead. We do not know. 
SPOCK: Exactly. I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me. 
SPOCK: Precisely. 
SPOCK: The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you. 
SPOCK: Very well, sir. Engineer? 
SPOCK: Your mind to my mind. Your thoughts to my thoughts. 
SPOCK: (to McCoy) The bullets are unreal. Without body. They are illusions only. Shadows without substance. They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist. 
SPOCK (to Kirk) Unreal. Appearances only. They are shadows. Illusions. Nothing but ghosts of reality. They are lies. Falsehoods. Spectres without body. They are to be ignored. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Melkotian object. 
SPOCK: The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, Captain. 
SPOCK: Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain. May I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal. 
SPOCK: This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you? 
SPOCK: But he wanted to, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: Mankind, ready to kill. 
SPOCK: I wonder how humanity managed to survive. 
SPOCK: It's in a border area, Mister Scott. The Klingons also claim jurisdiction. 
SPOCK: Sounds typical of the Elasians. The scientists who made the initial investigation reported the men were vicious and arrogant. 
SPOCK: Not without precedent, Captain. Remember that 
SPOCK: I am the first officer. This is Captain James Kirk. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided. 
SPOCK: I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational. 
SPOCK: At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost, but I've run checks on all the instrumentation. All the equipment is functioning perfectly. 
SPOCK: None in this area. Nothing that would account for it. The ghost appears intermittently. 
SPOCK: None, Captain. Insufficient data. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: That sensor ghost is moving closer. 
SPOCK: Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object enough to establish it was a spaceship. 
SPOCK: No data yet. 
SPOCK: Our ghost has materialised. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. The Klingon ship has simply moved into contact range. She is pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed and on a parallel course. 
SPOCK: Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless, anticipating that she would deny you admittance. However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me. 
SPOCK: I have it on my sensor, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. I am triangulating now. It's coming from the engineering section. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain? 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain. 
SPOCK: May we see you a moment? 
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? 
SPOCK: It is true then, Captain? 
SPOCK: Their speed is better than warp six, Captain. 
SPOCK: I don't think they meant to attack us. We were very fortunate this time. 
SPOCK: Very. But why do the Klingons consider the possession of this system so vital? 
SPOCK: I have another question, Captain. Is not the bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman at a time like this? 
SPOCK: They demand an immediate reply. 
SPOCK: We can still manoeuvre. 
SPOCK: Help could not arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed. 
SPOCK: He's passed us. All shields held. 
SPOCK: Better than warp seven. 
SPOCK: He's past us again. Damage to number four shield. 
SPOCK: It will not withstand another full charge, Captain. I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings. 
SPOCK: She is the source. 
SPOCK: The necklace. 
SPOCK: These are common stones? (scans them) See, Captain? Here and here. 
SPOCK: No doubt, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, these are crude crystals. There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow. 
SPOCK: Damage to Klingon number three shield. Number four shield obliterated. Loss of manoeuvre power. 
SPOCK: You are too late, Doctor. The Captain has found his own antidote. 
SPOCK: The antidote to a woman of Elas, Doctor, is a starship. The Enterprise infected the Captain long before the Dohlman did. 
SPOCK: In this particular instance, Doctor, I agree with you. 
SPOCK: Astronomical, Captain. The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way. 
SPOCK: An alien metal of some kind. An alloy resistant to probe. Readings can't even measure its age accurately. These incised symbols are fascinating. Evidently, some form of writing. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own. 
SPOCK: Bearing one one seven mark four. 
SPOCK: If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within thirty minutes. Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem, perhaps past solution. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: They are, Doctor. A mixture of Navajo, Mohican, and Delaware, I believe. All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes. 
SPOCK: Highly improbable, Captain. Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here. 
SPOCK: Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, Doctor. Our appearance here would only confuse and frighten them. 
SPOCK: Doctor? 
SPOCK: I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Prepare to beam us up, Mister Scott. We're warping out of orbit. 
SPOCK: Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon. Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute, but as the asteroid approaches this planet, the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship 
SPOCK: If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all. 
SPOCK: Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search. 
SPOCK: (picking up two stoned to illustrate his point) Doctor, assume this is the planet we're on. This is the approaching asteroid. If we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid. In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain. 
SPOCK: In the time it's taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here. The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it. Beam us up, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed. I do not intend to miss that 
SPOCK [OC]: Deflection point. 
SPOCK: Objection noted, Mister Scott. Carry on. 
SPOCK [OC]: Full power, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Then bypass the relays and go to manual control. 
SPOCK: I want full power, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Magnification factor twelve, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: All engines stop. Hold position here. 
SPOCK: Prepare to activate deflectors. 
SPOCK: Engineering, maintain full power. Full power. 
SPOCK: Not now. 
SPOCK: Activate deflectors. 
SPOCK: Degree of deflection, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Recircuit power to engines. Maximum speed heading three seven mark zero one zero. 
SPOCK: Correct, Mister Chekov. I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams. 
SPOCK: To destroy it. A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass. 
SPOCK: Incorrect. We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power. 
SPOCK: That, Doctor, is another calculated risk we must take. 
SPOCK: Co-ordinates, Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK: That is our target. The asteroid's weakest point. 
SPOCK: Lock all phasers on that mark. Maximum intensity, narrow beam. I want to split that fissure wide open. 
SPOCK: Very astute, Doctor. 
SPOCK: We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mister Scott can maintain power. 
SPOCK: Fire phasers. 
SPOCK: Rig for simultaneous firing, Mister Sulu. Commence simultaneous bombardment. 
SPOCK: Estimated repair time? 
SPOCK: I've already surmised that. Thank you, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: I accept the responsibility, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Mister Chekov, resume heading eight eight three mark four one. 
SPOCK: Exactly fifty nine point two two three days, Doctor, and that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way. 
SPOCK: Another calculated Vulcan risk, Doctor. 
SPOCK: There isn't time, Doctor. I must decipher those obelisk's symbols. They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing. 
SPOCK: I'm aware of that, Doctor. I'm also aware when we arrive at the planet, we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue. I believe those symbols are the key. 
SPOCK: I am not hungry, Doctor. And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks. 
SPOCK: My physical condition is not important, Doctor. That obelisk is. 
SPOCK: You prescribed rest, Doctor. The symbols on the obelisk are not words. They are musical notes. 
SPOCK: In a way, yes. Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words. The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet. 
SPOCK: Yes. The obelisk is a marker, just as I thought. It was left by a super-race known as the Preservers. They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow. 
SPOCK: So have I. Apparently the Preservers account for a number of them. 
SPOCK: Which has now become defective and is failing to operate. 
SPOCK: Precisely, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: We've located the captain. Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit. 
SPOCK: Hallucinations? 
SPOCK: The nurse has given you something to ease the pain. Why were you being stoned? 
SPOCK: Naturally, since he did not come from there. 
SPOCK:: Can you help him? 
SPOCK: Time, Doctor McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance. (communicator beeps) Spock here. 
SPOCK: Report noted. Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind fusion? 
SPOCK: I am Spock. You are James Kirk. Our minds are moving closer. Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk. Closer. 
SPOCK: James Kirk. 
SPOCK: Our minds are one. 
SPOCK: I am Kir 
SPOCK: Spock! 
SPOCK: His mind. He is an extremely dynamic individual. 
SPOCK: Captain, were you inside this structure? 
SPOCK: This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism. It is imperative that we get inside immediately. Captain, we do not have much time. 
SPOCK: If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next fifty minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed. 
SPOCK: I already have to some extent, Captain. They are musical notes. 
SPOCK: That would be one method. Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence. 
SPOCK: If you could remember your exact words, Captain. 
SPOCK: It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, Captain, but far more complicated. 
SPOCK: Probably a memory beam. You must have activated it out of sequence. 
SPOCK: I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, Captain. They would seem to indicate that this series of relays activated in their proper 
SPOCK: I did give a full report 
SPOCK; No, sir. Compliance presents no problem. 
SPOCK: Sensor scan to one half parsec. Negative, Captain. 
SPOCK: Increasing sensor scan to one parsec. All scanners report clear. Nothing in our immediate vicinity. 
SPOCK: Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design. 
SPOCK: A second ship has appeared. (another one decloaks) Correction, there are now three. We are surrounded. 
SPOCK: I have a theory, Captain. 
SPOCK: True, Captain. That would be standard Romulan procedure. 
SPOCK: It would be a great prize. 
SPOCK: I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless. 
SPOCK: If we had not crossed the Neutral Zone, on your order, you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made. 
SPOCK: Spock. 
SPOCK: I understand. 
SPOCK: Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel. 
SPOCK: It is no myth. 
SPOCK: I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan. 
SPOCK: You're being clever, Commander. That is unworthy of a Romulan. It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself. 
SPOCK: You would not resort to them, Commander. They would prove ineffective against the captain. 
SPOCK: I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed. The strain of command has worn heavily upon him. He's not been himself for several weeks. 
SPOCK: As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person. I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision. 
SPOCK: I'm betraying no secrets. The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the Neutral Zone is unacceptable. Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness. 
SPOCK: I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation. I say now and for the record, that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the Neutral Zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory. 
SPOCK: He is not sane. 
SPOCK: I am half Vulcan. My mother is a human. 
SPOCK: Vulcan. 
SPOCK: Eighteen years. 
SPOCK: The question is irrelevant. 
SPOCK: My duty as an officer is to obey him. 
SPOCK: I do not desire a ship of my own. 
SPOCK: Such opportunities are extremely rare. 
SPOCK: That thought has occasionally crossed my mind. 
SPOCK: Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship. You want the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Indeed. 
SPOCK: I am honoured, Commander. Are the guards also invited? 
SPOCK: Of course. I shall obey your restrictions. 
SPOCK: It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable. 
SPOCK: I am ready. 
SPOCK: The matter is not open for discussion, Doctor. 
SPOCK: There is no alternative, Doctor. The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue. It is misguided loyalty to resist any further. 
SPOCK: I was unprepared for his attack. I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip. 
SPOCK: I am very flattered, Commander. There's no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise. It is indeed a very powerful recruiting inducement. 
SPOCK: A place? 
SPOCK: I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society. 
SPOCK: Please believe me. I do appreciate it. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course, but not just this moment. An hour from now will do even better. Would it not, Commander? 
SPOCK: I was beginning to wonder. 
SPOCK: How rare, and how beautiful. But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier. 
SPOCK: Spock to Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK: Captain 
SPOCK [OC]: Are you prepared to beam over? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters. It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorised personnel. What is your present location? 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. At present, I am rather heavily 
SPOCK: Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation. 
SPOCK: I must confess that I too am moved emotionally. I know it is illogical. 
SPOCK: That will be profitless, Commander. I do not believe you will find it. 
SPOCK: I assure you I am quite sane. 
SPOCK: First officer of the Enterprise. (Broken-hearted, she slaps his face.) What is your present form of execution? 
SPOCK: I demand the Right of Statement first. 
SPOCK: Thank you. I shall not require much time. No more than twenty minutes, I should say. 
SPOCK: My crime is sabotage. I freely admit my guilt. (Scott is continuing to work) The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding. As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation. Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security. I carried out my duty. 
SPOCK: There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement. May I continue? 
SPOCK: Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty, there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience to duty. 
SPOCK: One hundred and fifty thousand kilometres, Captain, and closing very rapidly. 
SPOCK: One hundred thousand kilometres. They should commence firing at us within the next twelve point seven seconds. 
SPOCK: The cloaking device is working perfectly, and the commander has informed me that even the Romulan sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped. 
SPOCK: Deck two. It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger. It was not intentional. All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device. 
SPOCK: It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel. 
SPOCK: You underestimate yourself, Commander. 
SPOCK: Obviously. Military secrets are the most fleeting of all. I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent. 
SPOCK: It was the only choice possible. You would not respect any other. 
SPOCK: Captain, please go. Somehow they do not look aesthetically agreeable 
SPOCK [OC]: On humans. 
SPOCK: Miss Uhura, your last sub-space log contained an error in the frequencies column. 
SPOCK: Cry? 
SPOCK: Well, since it is illogical for a communications officer to resent the word frequency, I have no answer.
SPOCK: Vulcan has no moon, Miss Uhura. 
SPOCK: Bridge acknowledging. 
SPOCK: Explain. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, my demonstration of concern will not change what happened. The transporter room is very well-manned and they will call if they need my assistance.
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge to Dispensary. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Borgia plant listed in library record tapes as carbon group three vegetation similar to Earth nightshade family. Alkaloid poison. Chemical structure common to class M planets. About the strange mottling on his facial skin surface. There is no reference to this symptom. 
SPOCK: No mistake in our record tapes. Borgia plant. Its sole deadly property is alkaloid poison. 
SPOCK: Check out perfectly. They arrived here nearly five years ago. Visited by various vessels, made fairly heavy shipments out, of artefacts and reports. However, there has been a marked drop in shipments during the last year. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Sodium chloride. Not a trace of it. 
SPOCK: He would die almost instantly. 
SPOCK [OC]: Standing by. 
SPOCK [OC]: Complete analysis. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
SPOCK [OC]: It is the Borgia variety, Captain. Could not have caused Darnell's death. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK: Something odd, Captain. You said two people. 
SPOCK: We get a reading on only one person, probably Crater. He's circling as if searching for something. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: The simple fact is unless there's something seriously wrong with the ship's equipment, there's only one person within a one hundred mile circle. 
SPOCK: Spock cutting in, Captain. Something here, through the arches to your left. 
SPOCK: Green. 
SPOCK: Or something did.
SPOCK: Crater knows the creature. If we could take him alive. 
SPOCK: Obviously, taking him alive is going to be difficult. 
SPOCK: Why risk your life for his? 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Crater! (Kirk fires his phaser) 
SPOCK: The Earth buffalo. What about it? 
SPOCK: And now they're gone. Is that what you mean? 
SPOCK: Always in the past tense.
SPOCK: Supplies of salt have been set out as bait at all decks and engineering levels, Captain. However, no one or nothing has approached them as yet. 
SPOCK: Your attitude is laudable, Doctor, but your reasoning is reckless. 
SPOCK: A very interesting hypothesis, Doctor. Briefing room. 
SPOCK: Recommend we use truth serum, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'll accompany you, Doctor. 
SPOCK: (on biobed) It wasn't McCoy. It was the creature. It hit me. Crater grabbed my phaser. I wondered about McCoy. Doubt had crossed my mind. 
SPOCK: Fortunately, my ancestors spawned in another ocean than yours did. My blood cells are quite different.
SPOCK: It's killing the Captain. Shoot it, Doctor, quickly! 
SPOCK:&nbsp;It's killing the captain! Shoot, quick! 
SPOCK: This is not Nancy. (hitting her repeatedly) If she were Nancy, could she take this? 
SPOCK: Is that Nancy, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Something wrong, Captain? 
SPOCK: Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful. 
SPOCK: The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked. 
SPOCK: I stand corrected, Captain. Induced would be a more precise term. Induced by an outside force. 
SPOCK: The release of bacteria. Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced. 
SPOCK: I do not know, but it is possible. 
SPOCK: A valid assumption, I would say. 
SPOCK: Or the promise of reward. 
SPOCK: At present, yes. (his tricorder beeps) Odd. 
SPOCK: There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave. 
SPOCK: Definitely not humanoid, Captain. Impossible to make any specific identification. The readings do not correlate with any known information. 
SPOCK: I'm not aware of it, Captain. 
SPOCK: I am not familiar with anxiety, but I wasn't aware it could be registered on sensors. 
SPOCK: Are you all right, Captain? 
SPOCK: (enters) Captain, I have extracted the salient portion of Professor Starnes' tapes. 
SPOCK: Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses. 
SPOCK: There is another portion, Captain, which I believe you'll find particularly interesting. 
SPOCK: Unknown. 
SPOCK: He never completed the entry, and the dispatch was never sent. Except for scenes of family life, games and picnics with the children, that is the complete record. Whatever overwhelmed them must have done so with incredible speed. Otherwise, the professor would have provided details of the experience. He was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth. 
SPOCK: Possible, Captain. Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth. 
SPOCK: According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi. After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon. 
SPOCK: No, like so many legends, this one too has a frightening ending. It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into motion and send it marauding across the galaxy. 
SPOCK: I was speaking of a legend, Captain. 
SPOCK: According to Federation records, this is the first. 
SPOCK: He said an unseen force was influencing him, that he recognised it, was beginning to fight it and cancelled his request for a ship. 
SPOCK: I am unable to lock on to the proper co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus. 
SPOCK: Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet? 
SPOCK: This bridge is under complete control. 
SPOCK: There is no need. 
SPOCK: I cannot obey your order, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, we must get off this bridge. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Jim. 
SPOCK: Correct, Captain. 
SPOCK: Where to, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger. They are the carriers. 
SPOCK: They are followers. Without followers, evil cannot spread. 
SPOCK: Captain, the four hundred and thirty men and women on board the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children. 
SPOCK: Perhaps that is true, but the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it 
SPOCK: You take from those who do not know you. 
SPOCK: Why should you fear it? 
SPOCK: Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognised you too late. 
SPOCK: Configuration unidentified. Ion propulsion, high velocity, though of a unique technology. 
SPOCK: One. Humanoid or similar. Low level of activity. Life-support systems functioning. Interior atmosphere, conventional nitrogen-oxygen. Instruments indicate a transferal beam emanating from the area of the humanoid life form. 
SPOCK: Directed at the Bridge of the Enterprise, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Fascinating. Activity without end, but with no volition. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain? Captain Kirk? 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice. 
SPOCK [OC]: Is that you, Doctor McCoy, and are you with the Captain? 
SPOCK [OC]: Engineer Scott as well. Unfortunately, I do not know where I am. 
SPOCK [OC]: A practical idea, Captain. It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, Captain, I am still here. Have you returned to the Enterprise? 
SPOCK [OC]: I am not certain. I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity. 
SPOCK [OC]: Then what am l? 
SPOCK [OC]: Fascinating. It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature. 
SPOCK [OC]: Why are you endangering your lives by coming here? 
SPOCK [OC]: Back where? 
SPOCK [OC]: Thoughtful, Captain, but probably impractical. While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain. 
SPOCK [OC]: No denigration intended, Doctor McCoy. That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, I appreciate the risks you are taking on my behalf, but I must insist they are worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success. Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since 
SPOCK [OC]: Doctor McCoy must've told you that twenty four hours is the maximum my body can 
SPOCK [OC]: It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not? 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledged. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: I shall give it top priority. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, I have an answer for you. It seems your pain bands are manually controlled. The red button on a bracelet releases them. I know that does not make much sense. 
SPOCK [OC]: How very flattering. 
SPOCK [OC]: Fascinating. 
SPOCK [OC]: Indeed, Captain. That is unquestionably part of what I am doing. 
SPOCK [OC]: If I may explain, Captain. She refers to the tape storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place. I scan it. A most impressive store. 
SPOCK [OC]: It is a device with feeding circuits. They lead into the mind of the priestess leader. Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders. 
SPOCK [OC]: She is an alien. The configurations of her brain are different. It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, Doctor. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, you might lose the doctor that way. 
SPOCK [OC]: I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me. 
SPOCK: (hoarse) Yes. Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK: If you will finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be able to help. 
SPOCK: Yes. That's correct. One thing at a time. Ah, ah, mmm. (normal voice) That's better. Now, Doctor. Try the sonic separator. 
SPOCK: Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling. Please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions, one by one. In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct. You will then seal using the tri-laser connector. 
SPOCK: Ready. 
SPOCK: (twitching) Correct. 
SPOCK: Correct. 
SPOCK: Correct. Very good, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Congratulations, Doctor. And thank you. 
SPOCK: On the whole, Captain, I believe I am quite fit. Fascinating. A remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation. At the peak, advanced beyond any of our capabilities and now operating at this primitive level which you saw. And it all began thousands of years ago when a glacial age reoccurred. This underground complex was developed for the women. The men remained above, and a male-female schism took place. A fascinating cultural development of a kind which never 
SPOCK: (to Kara, amid laughter) As I was saying, a fascinating cultural development of the kind which hasn't been seen in ages. The last such occurrence took place on old Earth, when the Romans were warring with the .... 
SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Marvick. I shall be wearing the visor. 
SPOCK: It has proved effective for Vulcans. 
SPOCK: I shall endeavour to keep it under control. 
SPOCK: Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos. I am First Officer Spock. 
SPOCK: Captain Kirk, we are ready. 
SPOCK: Doctor Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with Ambassador Kollos. 
SPOCK: I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience. 
SPOCK: No one ever has. I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species. 
SPOCK: I was unable to accept. My life is here. 
SPOCK: Spock to Bridge. We have arrived at the Ambassador's quarters. 
SPOCK: I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the Ambassador. 
SPOCK: I almost envy you your assignment. 
SPOCK: Not correct, Doctor, although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine. Were you born a telepath? 
SPOCK: I understand. May I show you to your quarters? 
SPOCK: I understand. Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint. Do call when you are ready. 
SPOCK: Why, thank you, Captain. 
SPOCK: On the contrary, Doctor, I would say that Doctor Jones was indeed fortunate. 
SPOCK: Doctor Jones was born a telepath, Captain. 
SPOCK: What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions. 
SPOCK: As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I see, Doctor McCoy, you still subscribe to the outmoded notion, promulgated by your ancient Greeks, that what is good must also be beautiful. 
SPOCK: I'll escort you to your quarters. 
SPOCK: I genuinely intended to honour her, Captain. Good evening, gentlemen. 
SPOCK: Do you know whether he saw the Medusan? 
SPOCK: Then insanity will surely be the result, Captain. Dangerous insanity. 
SPOCK: Trying, Captain. Mister Chekov, your assistance, please. 
SPOCK: We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points. When we exceeded warp speed factor nine point five, we apparently entered a space-time continuum. 
SPOCK: Impossible to calculate. We lack data to analyse. Our instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense. Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a return course. We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed. And we cannot re-cross the barrier using sub light speed. 
SPOCK: An entertaining suggestion, Mister Chekov, but not very helpful. 
SPOCK: Very possibly. The Medusan sensory system is radically different from ours. Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency I might become Kollos. 
SPOCK: A fusion. A mind-link to create a double entity. Each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both. We will function as one being. 
SPOCK: If the link is successful there will be a tendency to lose separate identity. A necessary risk. Of course, Doctor Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link. 
SPOCK: Doctor Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos. In some ways, she is still most human, Captain, particularly in the depth of her jealousy. 
SPOCK: Not sufficient. Her telepathic powers are formidable. If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude. 
SPOCK: The Enterprise is at stake. It is not possible for you to be involved. 
SPOCK: This is not a duty that you can assume. I am aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there's a more important factor. The object is to pilot this ship. That is something you cannot do. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Evidently a highly sophisticated sensor web. My compliments to you, and to your dressmaker. 
SPOCK: An elegant solution. but I fail to understand why you apparently try to conceal your blindness, Doctor Jones. 
SPOCK: This is delightful. I know you. All of you. James Kirk, Captain and friend for many years. And Leonard McCoy, also of long acquaintance. And Uhura, whose name means freedom. 
SPOCK: Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, Doctor? 
SPOCK: In part. That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos. Ah, Miranda. There you are. 
SPOCK: My world is next for us. Captain Kirk, I speak for all of us you call Medusans. I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship. 
SPOCK: And now to the business at hand. With your permission, Captain. 
SPOCK: Co-ordination is completed. 
SPOCK: Warp one in six seconds. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. 
SPOCK: Position report, please, Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Chekov. Manoeuvre completed, Captain. 
SPOCK: How compact your bodies are. And what a variety of senses you have. This thing you call language though, most remarkable. You depend on it for so very much. But is any one of you really its master? But most of all, the aloneness. You are so alone. You live out your lives in this shell of flesh. Self-contained, separate. How lonely you are. How terribly lonely. 
SPOCK: So soon? 
SPOCK: You're a wise Captain. 
SPOCK: I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement. 
SPOCK: And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty. 
SPOCK: Live long and prosper, Miranda. 
SPOCK: Dust. Apparently these instruments have not been recently used. 
SPOCK: At that rate, it will take exactly seventy four point one solar hours for the storm to pass. 
SPOCK: Remember, Captain, what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. It doesn't register. 
SPOCK: Exactly one two one point three two metres beneath the planet surface, Captain. 
SPOCK: Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a matter-energy scrambler, similar to our own transporter mechanism. 
SPOCK: Captain, picking up a life-form reading bearing four two mark seven. 
SPOCK: Negative. Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo Sapiens. 
SPOCK: Impossible. I can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid. 
SPOCK: Approaching the life-form, Captain. 
SPOCK: Still undistinguishable. 
SPOCK: The sand-bats of Manark Four appear to be inanimate rock crystals, Doctor, until they attack. 
SPOCK: From what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet, a life-form such as hers could not evolve here. 
SPOCK: An unlikely possibility, Captain, since over ninety eight percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them. She's made no attempt to contact our minds. 
SPOCK: Gem, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Correct, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, in that direction, my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects. 
SPOCK: Electronically sophisticated devices. I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction. 
SPOCK: Research station six kilometres in that direction, Captain. 
SPOCK: Just ahead. 
SPOCK: I believe they were never actually present, Doctor. It was a mirage. 
SPOCK: Captain, it was a mirage. 
SPOCK: Captain, I request permission to be allowed 
SPOCK: Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings. I can find no exit out of here. 
SPOCK: Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, Doctor. Only your urging her on caused her to continue. 
SPOCK: Can you recall what happened, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vian's laboratory. 
SPOCK: I conclude such a light is an energy transfer point linking this device to the power source. 
SPOCK: If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us. 
SPOCK: I would say so. 
SPOCK: I do not know, Captain. I'm beginning to understand its operating principles, but that is all. 
SPOCK: Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface. 
SPOCK: I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, Doctor. Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments. 
SPOCK: Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so. 
SPOCK: How long will he be asleep, Doctor? 
SPOCK: I'm not criticizing your action, Doctor. On the contrary, I'm quite grateful for it. The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision. You have simplified the situation considerably. 
SPOCK: While the captain is asleep, I am in command. When the Vians return, I shall go with them. 
SPOCK: Precisely. The choice would have been the captain's. Now it is mine. 
SPOCK: Your action is highly unethical. My decision stands. 
SPOCK: I was convinced in the same way you were, Captain. By the good doctor's hypo. 
SPOCK: Hmm. A most unusual device. It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism. In fact, it is not a mechanical device. 
SPOCK: This control is attuned to one electrical pattern of energy, the pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it. It is activated solely by mental commands. 
SPOCK: I shall attempt to do so. However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time. I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern. Therefore, with your permission, I 
SPOCK: Fascinating. They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it. 
SPOCK: The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go. 
SPOCK: That is evidently their intention, Captain. 
SPOCK: Indeed, the facts would indicate that she's essential to their purpose. 
SPOCK: Completed, Captain. The adjustments are delicate. They may not survive more than even one use. However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: If you so desire. 
SPOCK: Severe heart damage. Signs of congestion in both lungs. Evidence of massive circulatory collapse. 
SPOCK: He's dying, Jim. We can make him comfortable, but that is all. 
SPOCK: Internal injuries. Bleeding in the chest and abdomen. Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver. Seventy percent kidney failure. 
SPOCK: It could happen anytime. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid not. 
SPOCK: Uncertain, Captain. Dr. McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it. However, we cannot be positive. 
SPOCK: What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure? Surely beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct. Your sun will nova. 
SPOCK: Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed. 
SPOCK: You were correct, Captain. Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them. This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test. 
SPOCK: Captain, Dr. McCoy's life is not solely dependent on Gem. The Vians too must be capable of saving his life. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field. 
SPOCK: It draws its energy from us, Captain. In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed. That might weaken the field. 
SPOCK: It is complete. Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet. She offered her life. 
SPOCK: What is puzzling you, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians. 
SPOCK: Possibly, Captain. I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are registering very curious readings from all sensors. 
SPOCK: I cannot. According to our instruments, space itself is literally breaking up. There is no known phenomenon which would account for these readings. 
SPOCK: Negative. I have run a complete check on all systems. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: There is virtually no sensor contact. No mass analysis. No trace of radiation. We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there. 
SPOCK: Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, Ensign. 
SPOCK: The ship is still functioning, Captain. It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard. 
SPOCK: Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: Request permission to remain, Captain. I could be completing the data. 
SPOCK: Captain, there is a chance 
SPOCK: Energise. 
SPOCK: Negative. 
SPOCK: Compute the next period of spatial interphase. 
SPOCK: We must try, Mister Scott. The fabric of space is very weak here. If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the Captain alive. 
SPOCK: Well, picture it this way, Mister Chekov. We exist in a universe which co-exists with a multitude of others in the same physical space. At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an area of ours. That is a time of interphase, during which we can connect with the Defiant's universe. 
SPOCK: Yes. However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar. Any use of power disturbs it. If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the Captain and become trapped ourselves. 
SPOCK: Chekov! Chekov! 
SPOCK: Security guards to the Bridge. 
SPOCK: I was attempting to explain to Mister Chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura is correct. There was murderous fury in Chekov. The same fury which was evident in the Defiant. 
SPOCK: Is there anything you need to isolate the cause? 
SPOCK: If we are to recover the Captain, we must not move. 
SPOCK: Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made. 
SPOCK: The Captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out. It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived. However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase, or he will die. And there can be no margin for error. His environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than three point six two hours. 
SPOCK: Status, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, signal Red Alert. 
SPOCK: Transfer to main viewer. 
SPOCK: Spock, in command of the Federation star ship Enterprise. Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space. 
SPOCK: We are not interested in your display of force. The Enterprise is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations. Do you wish to assist us? 
SPOCK: The other ship is interspatially trapped. It should reappear in one hour and fifty three minutes. We request you stand by until then. 
SPOCK: Bridge to transporter room. 
SPOCK [OC]: Ready for interphase in twenty seconds. 
SPOCK: Lock on to Captain Kirk's co-ordinates 
SPOCK [OC]: And prepare to bring him aboard, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bring him aboard, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK [OC]: Well, keep trying, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Sulu, evaluation. 
SPOCK: It's possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space, and if that has occurred 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Negative, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Theoretically it already has happened, Doctor. 
SPOCK [OC]: However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted. 
SPOCK: I did, Doctor. The space was disturbed by the Tholians. 
SPOCK [OC]: Not at this interphase. 
SPOCK: I shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur. They do not take place at regular intervals. 
SPOCK: I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, Doctor, and prevent further spread of the affliction. 
SPOCK: The renowned Tholian punctuality. 
SPOCK: Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures. Mister Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Understood. Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian ship. Mister Sulu, lock in phaser tracking controls. 
SPOCK: Ready, Mister Sulu? 
SPOCK: Fire. 
SPOCK: Engineering, status report. Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Can you estimate minimum time required for repair? 
SPOCK: The decision to fight was logical. Lack of time prevented any other course of action. The Tholian ship had to be disabled. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons. Please go to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects of this space. That is your primary task, since we must remain here. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Negative. Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the approaching vessel? 
SPOCK: Distance, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments. Tie in all sensors to the ship's library computer console. Switch scanners. 
SPOCK: There's no analogy to this structure in Federation technology. It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we shall not see home again. 
SPOCK: Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative. 
SPOCK: The urgency requires your personal attention in the laboratory. 
SPOCK: A few hours ago, the Captain elected to remain on board the Defiant so that three members of this crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise. His concern was not only for them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship. You all know the sequence of events. We were fired upon by the Tholian ship. At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive. I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise. The Tholian ship has been disabled. But as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive. 
SPOCK: I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded. Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts. 
SPOCK: It can wait, Doctor. My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge. 
SPOCK: It will wait for a more suitable moment, Doctor. 
SPOCK: The mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility, Doctor. At the moment, they are your top priority. 
SPOCK: We came here for a specific purpose, Doctor. 
SPOCK: The Captain would have remained to recover a crew member at the risk of his own life or even his own ship. 
SPOCK: I need not explain my rationale to you or any other member of this crew. There is a margin of variation in any experiment. While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the Captain's status. 
SPOCK: That is enough, Doctor. We both have other things to do. 
SPOCK: You will return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here. 
SPOCK: Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of duty. That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship. 
SPOCK: What would you have me say, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: I shall be there shortly. Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs. 
SPOCK: Spock here. Proceed, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Report to Doctor McCoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock out. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bridge. Spock here. 
SPOCK: Negative. We are relatively stable at the moment. 
SPOCK [OC]: Why do you ask? 
SPOCK [OC]: What is it, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Report to the bridge immediately. 
SPOCK: In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see. 
SPOCK: I was merely stating a fact, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Please leave that to me, Doctor McCoy. I realise that the crew are your prime concern. You can best serve them in your laboratory. I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found. 
SPOCK: I understand, Doctor. I'm sure the Captain would simply have said forget it, Bones. 
SPOCK: Captain? Captain? Captain. 
SPOCK: Exactly. But the Captain remained. Only the overlap time changed. The next interphase will occur here. 
SPOCK: Can you be ready? 
SPOCK: It will have to do, Mister Scott. (door buzzer) Come. 
SPOCK: You've found the antidote, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Ensign Chekov was affected so early. Has he responded to it? 
SPOCK: Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons. 
SPOCK: If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in pure form. 
SPOCK: Welcome back, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Your absence was keenly felt, Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK: Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web. 
SPOCK: Are the ships computers programmed for entry into interspace? 
SPOCK: Spock to engineering. 
SPOCK [OC]: Prepare for interphase in 
SPOCK: Fifteen seconds. 
SPOCK: Stand by with full power. 
SPOCK: It will have to do. 
SPOCK: Ready to transport on my order. 
SPOCK: Try to maintain position Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability.
SPOCK: Negative, Ensign. Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of it. Compute the distance from the original location. 
SPOCK: We shall soon see, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Good. Since the Captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should've been drawn here with us. Spock to transporter room. 
SPOCK [OC]: The Captain's oxygen supply is running out now. Are you standing by with a hypo of tri-ox compound for him? 
SPOCK: Prepare to transport on the Captain's co-ordinates on my order. 
SPOCK: I see him, Ensign. I see him. Now, Doctor. 
SPOCK: None worth reporting, Captain. 
SPOCK: Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved. 
SPOCK: Orders, Captain? 
SPOCK: No. You see, the crisis was upon us, and then passed so quickly, Captain, that we 
SPOCK: Do we have maximum magnification, Lieutenant? 
SPOCK: Very archaic type, Captain. Sub light speed. 
SPOCK: It would appear that the Enterprise is the target, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain? 
SPOCK: Correct, Captain. We are approaching those co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: An asteroid, two hundred miles in diameter. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. We've had that area on scanners constantly. 
SPOCK: Correct, Captain. 
SPOCK: Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting. It is pursing an independent course through this solar system. 
SPOCK: It is under power, Captain. And correcting for all gravitational stresses. 
SPOCK: Atomic. Very archaic. Leaving a trail of debris and hard radiation. 
SPOCK: Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow. It surrounds an independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere. Sensors read no life forms. 
SPOCK: Then the passengers, or builders, are dead. 
SPOCK: Interesting. 
SPOCK: The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it on a collision course with Daran Five. 
SPOCK: Correct. Population approximately three billion and seven hundred twenty four million, if memory serves me correctly. Estimated time of impact three hundred ninety six days. 
SPOCK: One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet. 
SPOCK: The asteroid ship is over ten thousand years old, Doctor. Still no sign of life forms, Captain. 
SPOCK: The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical shock. 
SPOCK: Nothing else could've caused this, Captain. At least nothing that has happened here. 
SPOCK: May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor? 
SPOCK: Yes. I know of it, Captain. 
SPOCK: Very well, Doctor. The Captain and I seem to have suffered no ill effects. 
SPOCK: Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command. 
SPOCK: Logical, Captain. 
SPOCK: Also logical, Captain. 
SPOCK: He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Doctor. The young lady did show a marked preference for your company. 
SPOCK: We are very interested in your world. 
SPOCK: Incredible as it may seem, these people have no idea they're living on a spaceship. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Oracle room. 
SPOCK: I believe that I can. (Kirks stops him as women walks past) The writing is definitely Fabrini, Captain. I recognise it. 
SPOCK: Yes. Towards the end, the Fabrini people lived underground, as these people do, to protect themselves. 
SPOCK: Captain. If I remember correctly, the oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform. 
SPOCK: Nothing here which would indicate this is anything but a planet. There's no question but that the creators would be considered gods. 
SPOCK: Eight planets, Captain. That is the number in the Fabrina solar system. 
SPOCK: And no doubt they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for ten thousand years. 
SPOCK: Your decision is most illogical, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I believe it's time to move on. 
SPOCK: She evidently understood something. There are no guards to detain us. 
SPOCK: Temperature one hundred eleven degrees and rising. 
SPOCK: Temperature one hundred fifteen degrees. 
SPOCK: One hundred twenty degrees. 
SPOCK: Yes, it is. 
SPOCK: It refers to the altar. Apply pressure to the centre until it opens. 
SPOCK: I've neutralised the heating elements. 
SPOCK: There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes. 
SPOCK: Yes. Let me check that engine. A very simple problem, easy to correct. 
SPOCK: I believe we can attempt the course correction, Captain. 
SPOCK: Guidance control's taking over. I believe we can allow this ship to go back to its automatic control. 
SPOCK: (spotting shelves of discs) Captain. Intelligence files. Their banks contain the total knowledge of the Fabrini, ready for the people to consult when they arrive at their destination. (scans them) And they seem to have amassed a great deal of medical knowledge. 
SPOCK: Your haemoglobin count is back to normal, Doctor, which indicates that the flow of oxygen to each cell of your body is back up to its abundantly energetic level. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
SPOCK: Sensors have picked up a Klingon ship, closing fast. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, the enemy ship is drifting, totally disabled. 
SPOCK: And we never fired upon her. 
SPOCK [OC]: Here, Captain. 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain. Transporter room. 
SPOCK: Our landing party is intact, Doctor. 
SPOCK: First group from the Klingon vessel, Captain. 
SPOCK: At the moment we received the distress signal from the colony on Beta Twelve A, the Klingons were too far distant to have been the attackers. Moreover, they also were apparently attracted by a distress call. 
SPOCK: Our log tapes will indicate our innocence in the present situation. 
SPOCK: Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, neither the Klingon technology nor ours, is capable of this. The instantaneous transmutation of matter. I doubt that they are responsible. 
SPOCK: None. However, if they had such power, would they not have used it to create more effective weapons and only for themselves? 
SPOCK: Scans indicate that our forces and those of the Klingons are exactly equal at thirty eight each. The Klingons control deck six and starboard deck seven, while we control all sections above. 
SPOCK: Most curious, Captain. There appear to be more life-energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise crew plus the Klingons. A considerable discrepancy. 
SPOCK: I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units. 
SPOCK: No additional Klingons detected, Captain. It is an alien life force, a single entity. I cannot ascertain its location. 
SPOCK: Readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis. Computer report. 
SPOCK: What purpose? 
SPOCK: If the alien is creating these events, Captain, it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am constrained to point out that since minds are evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true. 
SPOCK: An appropriate choice of terms. However, it is notoriously difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been drawn. 
SPOCK: We are attempting to end it, Doctor. By reason, preferably. There is an alien on board which may have created this situation. 
SPOCK: Easy, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. The result of stress? 
SPOCK: Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons. Apparently, it is by design that we fight. We seem to be pawns. 
SPOCK: It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately, and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities. 
SPOCK: Sensors may be operating. 
SPOCK: Alien detected in the engineering section, near reactor number three. 
SPOCK: Jim, he's not responsible. 
SPOCK: It would appear that the entity wants us alive. 
SPOCK: Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers. 
SPOCK: I understand, Doctor. I, too, felt a brief surge of racial bigotry. Most distasteful. 
SPOCK: Totally unfamiliar. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased. When the Lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy. 
SPOCK: This one appears to be strengthened by mental irradiations of hostility, violent intentions. 
SPOCK: To put it simply. And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation in order to satisfy that need. It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict. 
SPOCK: Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated. The fighting must end and soon. 
SPOCK: The alien is affecting his mind, Captain. Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it. 
SPOCK: There's nothing we can do about it. 
SPOCK: We have nine minutes, fifty three seconds to power zero. 
SPOCK: There is, of course, a logical alternative. Kang's wife is, after all, our prisoner. Perhaps a threat. 
SPOCK: Eight minutes, forty two seconds. 
SPOCK: It has rarely been done because of the danger involved. Pinpoint accuracy is required. If the transportee should materialise inside a solid object, a deck or wall. 
SPOCK: No one can guarantee the actions of another. 
SPOCK [OC]: Your automatic setting is laid in, Captain. 
SPOCK: When transporter is energised, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads. 
SPOCK [OC]: You'll know in seven point nine seconds, Captain. 
SPOCK: Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, Doctor. Otherwise, it is not stopped. 
SPOCK: All fighting must end, Captain, to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone. 
SPOCK: The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain. I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon. 
SPOCK: How is the power transmitted? 
SPOCK: Do these waves cease while you are asleep? 
SPOCK: Thirty five. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of Parmen's delirium. 
SPOCK: How does one obtain the power? 
SPOCK: Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here. 
SPOCK: Even if he shouldn't. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold. 
SPOCK: Obviously Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain. 
SPOCK: Agreed, Captain. And Parmen wouldn't have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty, and above all, justice. 
SPOCK: Two spacemen marching to a drum. 
SPOCK: We slith among the mimsey toves, and gyre among the borogoves. 
SPOCK: I trust they did not injure you too much, Captain. 
SPOCK: The humiliation must have been most difficult for you to bear. I can understand. 
SPOCK: That may be, Doctor. However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you. 
SPOCK: So it would seem. Captain. 
SPOCK: Do you still feel anger toward Parmen? 
SPOCK: And you, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine. I might have seriously injured you, Captain, even killed you. They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further. I must master it. I must control. 
SPOCK: Alexander, it is possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that that power began to develop? 
SPOCK: And would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you? 
SPOCK: That's close enough, Alexander. Fascinating. Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods. 
SPOCK: Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods. 
SPOCK: Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element. 
SPOCK: The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius. 
SPOCK: The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis. They also regulate body growth. 
SPOCK: Yes. It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia secret. Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power. 
SPOCK: The point is well taken. However, the psychokinetic power is not additive. If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen. 
SPOCK: The time factor concerns me. It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us. 
SPOCK: I have experienced a slight flush, Captain. 
SPOCK: (singing) Take care, young ladies, and value your wine. Be watchful of young men in their velvet prime. 
SPOCK: We have tried. 
SPOCK: I haven't the power. I'm deeply sorry. We've failed you. 
SPOCK: Quite possible and logical. 
SPOCK: That would be highly uncharacteristic. We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone and you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your twenty five hundred years have made you. 
SPOCK: Evidently a civilisation of high order, rating number seven on the industrial scale. Humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings. An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed. Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy while others are apparently long abandoned. 
SPOCK: Instrument readings indicate life-form, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature. They have no discernible form or location. A most puzzling phenomenon, Captain. I shall have to study it further. 
SPOCK: Unknown at present, Captain. 
SPOCK: It is logical to assume that this distress call was pre-recorded. What we received was evidently a delayed taped message. 
SPOCK: It would seem that some force or agent only partially discernible to our instruments may have been responsible. 
SPOCK [OC]: (bad static) Captain, I have a reading from Life Support centre 
SPOCK: I have a reading from Life Support centre. Alien substances being introduced. 
SPOCK: It is a force field, Captain, the nature of which I'm not familiar with. I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location. 
SPOCK: It would seem, Captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter. I should advise caution. 
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. But it is evidently a device of alien origin. 
SPOCK: Life support is still operating. I would say that the installation is incomplete. 
SPOCK: It seems that we may look at it, Captain, but that is all. 
SPOCK: Yes. Evidently they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. 
SPOCK: Computer, analyse and reply. Have we been invaded? 
SPOCK: Nature and description of enemy forces. 
SPOCK: Number of enemy forces. 
SPOCK: Purpose of the invasion? 
SPOCK: Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance? 
SPOCK: Are we at present capable of resisting? 
SPOCK: Your recommendation? 
SPOCK: Your recommendations, Captain? 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, did you see what happened? 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, do you verify? 
SPOCK: I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet. Mister Sulu, did you drink your coffee? 
SPOCK: Did anyone else? 
SPOCK: May I? 
SPOCK: I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed. 
SPOCK: I suggest that we recall the captain's words, Make them take the next step. It would seem they have taken it. And we must determine effective countermeasures. Mister Scott, you have the conn. I shall be in the medical lab. 
SPOCK: Nurse, programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents. (there's a buzz) Doctor, did you just 
SPOCK: I know what it is. We brought it with us from Scalos. If you'll excuse me, I shall be on the bridge. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer? 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Bring it to the bridge at once, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level. 
SPOCK: That is a very logical suggestion. Stand by in the transporter room. 
SPOCK: Yes, it counteracts the substance most effectively. 
SPOCK: By drinking the Scalosian water. (and does so) 
SPOCK: It is somewhat stimulating. You seem to be moving very slowly, Doctor. Fascinating. 
SPOCK: If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy and I have synthesised a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water. Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it. 
SPOCK: You do seem to be moving very slowly, Captain. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Captain. I found it an accelerating experience. 
SPOCK: I suggest no supernatural explanation, Captain. I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets. 
SPOCK: Undoubtedly. The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years. It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period. 
SPOCK: But its mass and atmosphere are similar to Earth. 
SPOCK: It would be impossible, Captain. An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time. 
SPOCK: Evidently. But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon. 
SPOCK: Precisely, Captain. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Rahda, report to the bridge immediately. 
SPOCK: Yes. I believe no permanent damage was done. 
SPOCK: The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the chair. 
SPOCK: That we have yet to ascertain. 
SPOCK; Dead? Spock to Sickbay. 
SPOCK: Report on the death of the transporter officer. 
SPOCK: Give me a full report as soon as possible, please. Spock out. Mister Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction. 
SPOCK: The stars. 
SPOCK: Wrong? 
SPOCK: A positional change. 
SPOCK: Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years to be exact, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation. It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of nine hundred and ninety point seven light years. 
SPOCK: That is correct, Mister Scott, by all the laws that we know. There was no period of unconsciousness. Our ship's chronometers registered a matter of only a few seconds. Therefore, we were displaced through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom. 
SPOCK: Please, Mister Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic. I have said nothing. I was merely speculating. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Explain. 
SPOCK: Would any known disease organism do that? 
SPOCK: Please keep me fully advised. Spock out. He was in the transporter room. Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left. Mister Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed. 
SPOCK: In that case, Mister Scott, I suggest we start at once. Can you give me warp eight? 
SPOCK: That position, Mister Scott, would not only be unavailing but also undignified. Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course. 
SPOCK: Good. Then prepare to come to warp eight. 
SPOCK: Eleven point three three seven hours, Lieutenant. I wish you would be more precise. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Feels, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: That is obvious, Mister Scott. I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock out. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Do you know what he died of, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Security alert, all decks. Female intruder, extremely dangerous. Security alert. All decks. 
SPOCK: Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, Doctor? 
SPOCK: Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer? 
SPOCK: My guess, Doctor, would be valueless. I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock out. 
SPOCK: The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger. 
SPOCK: A reasonable assumption, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger. 
SPOCK: Very well. Cancel Red Alert but maintain increased security. 
SPOCK: Please update our subspace report to Starfleet to include security search, results negative. 
SPOCK: Presumably the same way she got on. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling. We are proceeding in the only logical way to return to the place they were last seen, and factually ascertain whether or not they still live. 
SPOCK: Very well. Reduce speed to warp seven. 
SPOCK: Bridge to Engineering. Negative effect on power reduction. Speed is still increasing. 
SPOCK: I would calculate fourteen point eight seven minutes, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Sabotage. 
SPOCK: You said it was fused. How? 
SPOCK: Worries, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Interesting. 
SPOCK: No, but the method is fascinating. 
SPOCK: A force that could hurl us nine hundred and ninety point seven light years away and at that distance still be able to sabotage our main source of energy will not be waiting around to be taken into custody. 
SPOCK: As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter-antimatter reaction chamber. 
SPOCK: Still, it is there, and it might be possible to shut off the fuel at that point. 
SPOCK: A magnetic probe. 
SPOCK: I shall try. 
SPOCK: Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us. 
SPOCK: Very well, Mister Scott. You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong. 
SPOCK: I note it, Mister Scott, without necessarily understanding it. I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers, comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition. 
SPOCK: We have twelve minutes and twenty seven seconds. I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway, while I make the computer study. 
SPOCK [OC]: Go ahead, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions. You now have ten minutes and nineteen seconds in which to perform your task. 
SPOCK: You now have ten minutes and ten seconds. 
SPOCK: I'm aware of these facts. Please get on with the job. Computer. 
SPOCK: Analysis on my comparison co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the magnetic force? 
SPOCK: Please do not take your eyes off of it. Lieutenant Rahda, arm the pod jettison system. 
SPOCK: Not until my order. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, what is your situation? 
SPOCK: You have eight minutes, forty one seconds. 
SPOCK: Computer read-out. 
SPOCK: Continue. 
SPOCK: Understood. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, ease off. 
SPOCK: Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve closure? 
SPOCK: Mister Scott 
SPOCK [OC]: Reverse polarity on your magnetic probe. 
SPOCK [OC]: That is correct, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Please commence. I'll explain. 
SPOCK [OC]: You were correct in your feel. The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled slightly out of phase. Reverse polarity should seal the incision. 
SPOCK: Please continue, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Please continue. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, you have accomplished your task. 
SPOCK: For what purpose, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK [OC]: What is it in you humans 
SPOCK [OC]: That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated, and yet you 
SPOCK: Feel that something else is necessary. 
SPOCK: I had the same misgivings about you. We returned and picked up your life form readings only a moment ago. 
SPOCK: From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise. Nine hundred and ninety point seven light years across the galaxy. What a remarkable culture this is. 
SPOCK: I surmised that, Captain. Its moves were immensely logical. But what people created this? Are there any representatives here? 
SPOCK: That is a loss, Captain. 
SPOCK: To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available. Losira's. 
SPOCK: Beauty is transitory, Doctor. However, she was evidently highly intelligent. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain? 
SPOCK: Check out the life-support systems. 
SPOCK: Someone strangled this woman.
SPOCK: Dead?
SPOCK: Engineer at his post?
SPOCK: The rest?
SPOCK: Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you read, Enterprise? 
SPOCK: All station personnel are dead.
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before. 
SPOCK: You received my signal, Mister Scott.
SPOCK: The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.
SPOCK: I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.
SPOCK: Next tape, please.
SPOCK: Thank you.
SPOCK: He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
SPOCK: It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present.
SPOCK: Instruments register only those things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
SPOCK: We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit. When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field.
SPOCK: It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
SPOCK: All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.
SPOCK: Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected. A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours.
SPOCK: Psychiatric file, personality quotients. 
SPOCK: It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.
SPOCK: His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force. 
SPOCK: Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us. 
SPOCK: Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
SPOCK: Rate of compaction seems constant.
SPOCK: Acknowledged.
SPOCK: Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
SPOCK: Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)
SPOCK: You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
SPOCK: You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station.
SPOCK: Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
SPOCK: Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.
SPOCK: Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were
SPOCK: Precisely.
SPOCK: Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century.
SPOCK: Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
SPOCK: Engine room, we need power!
SPOCK: Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
SPOCK: Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere.
SPOCK: Status reports, all sections.
SPOCK: Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
SPOCK: We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is.
SPOCK: No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir. (ship is jolted severely)
SPOCK: Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down.
SPOCK: Crewman, report to the lab!
SPOCK: What's going on?
SPOCK: Crewman, stand aside.
SPOCK: Message from the captain.
SPOCK: We have fourteen minutes left.
SPOCK: At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor. 
SPOCK: Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
SPOCK: Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!
SPOCK: What is it, Nurse?
SPOCK: Nurse, you should
SPOCK: I'm in control of my emotions.
SPOCK: I'm sorry.
SPOCK: I am sorry.
SPOCK: Christine.
SPOCK: (close to tears) I'm in control of my emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty. My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four, six. Six. Six times six. 
SPOCK: My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
SPOCK: An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste.
SPOCK: I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed.
SPOCK: t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)
SPOCK: It's never been done.
SPOCK: Jim.
SPOCK: Jim, there is an intermix formula.
SPOCK: It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.
SPOCK: Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
SPOCK: Fuel temperature.
SPOCK: Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
SPOCK: We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready. 
SPOCK: Are you all right, Jim?
SPOCK: Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
SPOCK: Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space.
SPOCK: We're back to normal time, Captain.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. 
SPOCK: This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.
SPOCK: That is exactly what it is, Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK: Captain, there is one living creature aboard. Humanoid. He is either injured or ill. His craft shows internal atmospheric leakage. The creature may be suffocating. 
SPOCK: You are certain, Doctor, that this pigmentation is the natural condition of this individual? 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. 
SPOCK: There is no theory, Captain, from the basic work of Mendel to recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive. All gradations of colour from black to brown, to yellow to white are genetically predictable. We must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind. 
SPOCK: Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were a human. 
SPOCK: With your permission, Captain, I shall do some further research and join you on the bridge. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. 
SPOCK: There is a vessel out there, Captain. 
SPOCK: Negative. This would not be a Romulan vessel. It is totally alien in configuration. Motive power unknown. Small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew. 
SPOCK: Nothing identifiable. The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat. 
SPOCK: None. Completely elusive. In fact, it's invisible. 
SPOCK: There is no sensor failure. The readings persist. 
SPOCK: It just disintegrated. Fascinating. 
SPOCK: It is gone now, Captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien presence. 
SPOCK: A most unique craft. Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study. 
SPOCK: Elusive, Captain. I am investigating. 
SPOCK: Confirmed, Captain. Holding pattern. Co-ordinates now indicate we are charting course to (pause) Captain, Cheron lies between four oh three mark seven and mark nine. 
SPOCK: Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus. 
SPOCK: This is Commander Spock, science officer. Destruct sequence number two, code one, one A, two B. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. We are still headed directly for Cheron. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. The Enterprise is now moving in a circular course. 
SPOCK: Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, Captain. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Two irrevocably hostile humanoids. 
SPOCK: That description is not scientifically accurate. 
SPOCK: Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate. There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated. The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet. 
SPOCK: We do not know that Lokai has done that. 
SPOCK: The obvious visual evidence, Commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself. 
SPOCK: Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you. Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threaten to destroy Cheron. We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional, often committed to irrationally opposing points of view, leading, of course, to death and destruction. Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction. 
SPOCK: Change is the essential process of all existence. For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured. 
SPOCK: The actual theory is that all life-forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages. 
SPOCK: Trouble, Mister Chekov? 
SPOCK: Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer are burned out. 
SPOCK: I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron. 
SPOCK: Coming within visual range now, Captain. 
SPOCK: Several large cities, uninhabited. Extensive traffic systems, barren of traffic. Lower animal sand vegetation encroaching on the cities. No sapient life-forms registering at all, Captain. There is no evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities. 
SPOCK: All dead, Captain. They have annihilated each other totally. 
SPOCK: None at all, sir. 
SPOCK: Where can he go? 
SPOCK: Captain, I have located them on ship's sensors. Bele is chasing Lokai on deck three. Bele is passing recreation room three, approaching the crewmen's lounge. Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge. Lokai has just arrived on deck five. Passing recreation room three. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Transporter room is clear. However, there is a life-form materialising on the planet. It is Lokai. He is back on Cheron. 
SPOCK: It is Bele, Captain. And another life-form has appeared on Cheron. 
SPOCK: To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical. 
SPOCK: Not to Lokai and Bele. All that matters to them is their hate. 
SPOCK: Governor. 
SPOCK: Governor, you indicated one additional inmate since our last visit, making a total of fifteen. Is that correct? 
SPOCK: A total of fifteen incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure. Who is the new inmate? 
SPOCK: She sounds rational enough, Captain. 
SPOCK: Very well indeed, thank you, Captain. 
SPOCK: (muttering) If you could create a diversion, I might be able to find the control room and open the force field. 
SPOCK: I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word. 
SPOCK: Yes. It is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school. Of course, the children are not so well co-ordinated. 
SPOCK: On what, precisely, is our friendship to be based? 
SPOCK: Why? 
SPOCK: How could you, a Starship fleet Captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits? 
SPOCK: Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion. However, what he says is logical and I do, in fact, agree with it. 
SPOCK: Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet? 
SPOCK: Captain Garth 
SPOCK: As you wish. At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to recreate the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place. 
SPOCK: On the contrary. You were treated with justice, and with compassion which you failed to show towards any of your intended victims. Logically, therefore, one must assume 
SPOCK: She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity. Interesting. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Captain. (draws a phaser) We're now armed. I presume we shall try to reach the control room. 
SPOCK: Force field is now off, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once. Your safety is vital to the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: I also request permission to remain here in charge of the security team when they beam down. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, the Captain's life is in immediate danger. Beam him aboard at once. The security team will be entrusted to me. 
SPOCK: He's waiting for the proper reply, Captain. 
SPOCK: Give him the countersign, Captain. 
SPOCK: Queen to queen's level three. 
SPOCK: Arranging to beam down a security team. Are there any objections? 
SPOCK: Fascinating. What maneuver did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti? 
SPOCK: Agreed, Captain. Captains. Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk. That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time. 
SPOCK: Captain Kirk, I presume. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Queen to king's level one. 
SPOCK: I am Mister Spock, science officer on a Starship. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: It was not impossible, Captain. Our presence here is proof of that. 
SPOCK: The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, Captain. It only seemed long to you. I was waiting for a victor in the hand to hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth. Because of your depleted condition. Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced to use other means to make my determination. 
SPOCK: I shall be interested in hearing your description, Captain. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura. 
SPOCK: Do we have final clearance from Gideon? 
SPOCK: May I have them, please? 
SPOCK: Eight seven five. 
SPOCK: Zero two zero. 
SPOCK: Zero seven nine. 
SPOCK: Energising. 
SPOCK: Put it on the screen. 
SPOCK: This is Mister Spock, Ambassador Hodin. Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago. 
SPOCK: I transported him myself. 
SPOCK: He was beamed directly to your council chambers. Please verify your co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: I am not questioning that, sir. 
SPOCK: I do not deny that, sir. I am not attempting to blame your personnel. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error which must be dealt with. 
SPOCK [OC]: It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency. May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy. If you will grant permission 
SPOCK: We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis. 
SPOCK: We are representatives of the Federation, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment. The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore we cannot scan it. Therefore we are unable to select co-ordinates. They must be provided by Gideon. 
SPOCK: We did not, Mister Chekov. The Federation did. Lieutenant Uhura. 
SPOCK: Contact Starfleet immediately. Explain our problem. Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK: There are endless, Mister Chekov. 
SPOCK: Institute a sensor scan three hundred and sixty degrees, one degree at a time. 
SPOCK: Then the sooner you begin, the better. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our request with a reply? 
SPOCK: Did you advise them the captain's life is at stake? 
SPOCK: What department? 
SPOCK: Contact them directly. 
SPOCK: Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they achieve exactly the same results. 
SPOCK [on screen]: But that is not what we requested. 
SPOCK [on screen]: Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency. 
SPOCK [on screen]: Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds, and there's no need to check your records. I merely suggest that the language of our statement may not have been understood exactly as intended. 
SPOCK: True, Your Excellency. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist. Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also. 
SPOCK: Yes, Your Excellency. 
SPOCK: Yes, Your Excellency. 
SPOCK: I apologise for the noise, your Excellency. To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, you'll go to the transporter room and await my orders. 
SPOCK: Yes, Your Excellency. The ship's engineer was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired. We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment. I, therefore, request permission 
SPOCK [OC]: To beam down to your council chamber. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency, grant this one request. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Your Excellency. Your proposal is accepted. Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon council. 
SPOCK [OC]: Co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely, and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon. 
SPOCK: Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon. 
SPOCK: Do not give up hope. Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command. Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon. 
SPOCK: Admiral, the crew will not understand it. 
SPOCK: We wish only to save the life of the captain. 
SPOCK: I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, Admiral. I have been convinced, since my first exchange with the ambassador, that the captain has been taken prisoner. 
SPOCK: I now know where the captain is being held, if he is being held at the same place to which we transported him. 
SPOCK: Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber. He is being held nearby. 
SPOCK: Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on the spot investigation. 
SPOCK: Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary. 
SPOCK: They did not ask for our understanding, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet. 
SPOCK: I do not make it lightly, Doctor. However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us. Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon co-ordinates for beam down. 
SPOCK: Mister Scott, the co-ordinates given you? 
SPOCK: Precisely. I shall beam down at once. Mister Scott, you have the conn. 
SPOCK: Negative, Doctor. I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive. I can make such a decision only for myself. 
SPOCK: The situation forces me to do so, Doctor. 
SPOCK: This will not take long. 
SPOCK: (into intercom) Captain Kirk. Spock here. Captain Kirk? 
SPOCK: An exact duplicate of the Enterprise. But completely inoperative. (into communicator) Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: I am speaking to you from the bridge of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK [OC]: On the bridge of the Enterprise, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: And they were correct. I'm on board an exact duplicate of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: In orbit, Doctor. In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit and the ship is on Gideon. 
SPOCK: I'm sure he's on board somewhere. I'm picking up life readings. Spock out. 
SPOCK: Your Excellency. Captain, you're looking well. Evidently Starfleet's analysis was correct. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK [OC]: Three to beam up, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Negative. Lock in on my communicator signal. Your Excellency, please do not interfere. I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons. 
SPOCK: Indications are a storm, Captain, although I've never seen one of such great intensity or strange confirmation. 
SPOCK: All sensor readings are at maximum calibration. 
SPOCK: It is definitely doing so, Captain. Therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature. 
SPOCK: Some equipment was temporarily out of order. My sensors were inoperative. 
SPOCK: None, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, it was not a storm. 
SPOCK: Only of the result, not of the cause. In each case, a different area of the brain was affected. Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure. 
SPOCK: Attack might be a more precise formulation, Captain. 
SPOCK: It is of little consequence, Captain. Memory Alpha has no protective shields. 
SPOCK: None, Captain. When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose. Since the information on the Memory planet is available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary. 
SPOCK: It varies with the number of scholars, researchers, and scientists from the various Federation planets who are using the computer complex. 
SPOCK: Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, Captain. 
SPOCK: None. 
SPOCK: A disaster for the galaxy, Captain. The central brain is damaged. The memory core is burned out. The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable. 
SPOCK: A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, Captain. 
SPOCK: Negative. 
SPOCK: The attack was thorough. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, I assure you that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet. It is probably seeking other victims. 
SPOCK: No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon. 
SPOCK: I'm having difficulty with the ship's sensors. They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were. 
SPOCK: Ship's sensors are operating at the moment. Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. Maintaining its distance. However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute, and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy. 
SPOCK: Not what is it, Captain. What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital. 
SPOCK: Impossible to determine without programming for computer analysis. 
SPOCK: I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units. Their attack is in the form of brain waves directed against the brain, which is most compatible. 
SPOCK: Perhaps it did not understand. 
SPOCK: It appears so. 
SPOCK: Not directly. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that. Captain, there is only one possible defence. If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form. 
SPOCK: I am, Captain. I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer. It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers. 
SPOCK: And you are sure that this is the correct slide? 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, it also happens to be tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units. 
SPOCK: As I said, Captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run. Computer, run a detailed comparison brain circuitry patterns, tape D and tape H. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine. Their thoughts are becoming hers. 
SPOCK: At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, Captain. 
SPOCK: She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned. 
SPOCK: Captain, we must deal with them directly, now, while she still retains partial identity. We can speak to them. They will answer using her voice. 
SPOCK: That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed. 
SPOCK: They will not accept their own deaths. 
SPOCK: Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat. 
SPOCK: The weightless state has become their natural condition. 
SPOCK: We may tax Mister Scott's patience, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Particularly where humans are involved, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is correct, Captain. While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well. I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure. 
SPOCK: You mean, love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion. I suppose it is possible. However 
SPOCK: Logical. 
SPOCK: It is, Captain. 
SPOCK: They've already been provided to the transport officer, Captain. Along with those of the council chamber of the High Advisor. 
SPOCK: Stratos, Captain. A city actually floating in the sky. 
SPOCK: It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy. Have you ever visited here, Captain? 
SPOCK: I've never had the opportunity. However, I hear its art forms are incomparable. 
SPOCK: It is a totally intellectual society. All forms of violence have been eliminated. 
SPOCK: Perhaps there is another entrance, Captain. 
SPOCK: It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery. 
SPOCK: Greetings, Mister Advisor. 
SPOCK: The Disrupters? Who are they? 
SPOCK: Remarkable. The finest example of sustained antigravity elevation I've ever seen. 
SPOCK: Nor I a work of art, madam. 
SPOCK: Despoil? For what purpose? 
SPOCK: Mister Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet. Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow. 
SPOCK: But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone. 
SPOCK: That would be most welcome, Mister Advisor. 
SPOCK [OC]: This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts. Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens. It is not a wise leadership. Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant. The High Advisor's charming daughter Droxine, particularly so. The name Droxine seems appropriate for her. I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred. The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation. If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miner's misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her. 
SPOCK: Your movements awakened me. 
SPOCK: Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible. 
SPOCK: The same may be said of Stratos inhabitants. 
SPOCK: We do pride ourselves on our logic. 
SPOCK: The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcan's. At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations. 
SPOCK: Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam. 
SPOCK: Am I intruding, Captain? 
SPOCK: In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos. 
SPOCK: But they are not allowed to share its advantages. 
SPOCK: The surface of the planet is almost unendurable. To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture. 
SPOCK: Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term. Its technical translation is cave dweller. 
SPOCK: Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam? 
SPOCK: All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice. 
SPOCK: But they're all the same species. Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet. Their physical and mental evolution must be similar. That is basic biological law. 
SPOCK: Incredible. Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria. No side effects have ever been reported. 
SPOCK: As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period. It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off. 
SPOCK: Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mister Advisor. 
SPOCK: Nor much time. We have ten hours and forty minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak Two. 
SPOCK: Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the High Advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed, if he chooses. 
SPOCK: Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. We've been trying to make contact, Captain. Is anything wrong? 
SPOCK: Locked in and ready to beam up consignment. 
SPOCK: Standing by for instructions. 
SPOCK: Instructions clear. I shall carry them out immediately. Spock out. 
SPOCK: That's not an exact quote, Mister Scott. However, it does express the thought. 
SPOCK: You will have that opportunity. 
SPOCK: Now that is an exact quote, Mister Scott, and I suggest you handle the transporter yourself. This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us and in diplomacy for the captain. 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
SPOCK: You'll have to delay. 
SPOCK: Picking up two life-forms in the gallery. 
SPOCK [OC]: They are inseparably close to one another. We cannot transport one 
SPOCK: Without the other. 
SPOCK: Precisely, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Until the High Advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait. Unless you have an alternative? 
SPOCK: Spock to transporter room. 
SPOCK: Lock in on Council Gallery co-ordinates. 
SPOCK: Energise. 
SPOCK: How are you doing, Mister Scott? 
SPOCK: Beam him down to Captain Kirk immediately. 
SPOCK: Good work, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm. 
SPOCK: Contact check, Captain. It has been over an hour since your last communication. 
SPOCK: Standing by, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: However, let me remind you, we have only five hours left to 
SPOCK: That is very unlike the captain. 
SPOCK: Enterprise, Spock here. 
SPOCK: Captain, the zenite gas has affected you. Captain! The zenite gas! 
SPOCK: It is less technical, therefore less accurate, but perhaps more generally descriptive of the function. 
SPOCK: There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below, and only one way to really experience it. 
SPOCK: No. No, Vulcan is quite different. 
SPOCK: Two hours, fifty-nine minutes to be exact, Captain. 
SPOCK: It is definitely the stolen space cruiser, Captain, the Aurora. I read six aboard. 
SPOCK: I read no evidence of malfunction. 
SPOCK: Their engines are seriously overheating, Captain. 
SPOCK: Power approaching critical. They cannot continue. 
SPOCK: Power beyond critical. Explosion is imminent. 
SPOCK: Captain, with your permission 
SPOCK: One. 
SPOCK: One is the beginning. 
SPOCK: I am not Herbert. 
SPOCK: If you will state your purpose and your objectives, perhaps we can arrive at a mutual understanding. 
SPOCK: I would prefer that you state it. 
SPOCK: What is your destination? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: Many myths are based on truth, Captain, and they are not unintelligent. Their leader, Doctor Sevrin, is a man 
SPOCK: Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications and electronics on Tiburon. He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies. 
SPOCK: There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created. It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilised, artfully balanced atmospheres. They hunger for an Eden where spring comes. 
SPOCK: Yes, that is true, Captain. 
SPOCK: It is not sympathy so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar. 
SPOCK: It is somewhat uncomplimentary, Captain. Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought. 
SPOCK: I shall make an attempt, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: They respect you. They will listen to your reasoning. For their sake, you must stop them. Doctor Sevrin, I'm in a position to help you and your group. I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location. I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet. Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime. However, incitement to disaffection is criminal. The Federation will never allow the colonisation of a planet by criminals. If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden. 
SPOCK: Then you knew you were a carrier. 
SPOCK: What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders. 
SPOCK: Your very presence will destroy the people you seek. Surely you know that. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Doctor Sevrin is insane. I've not consulted Doctor McCoy, but I have no doubt of it. 
SPOCK: His condition does not affect my interest in the movement. There is no insanity in what they seek. I made a promise which I should like to keep. With your permission, I must locate Eden. I shall work in my quarters. May I have the assistance of Mister Chekov in auxiliary control? 
SPOCK: Come in. 
SPOCK: No. 
SPOCK: If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes. 
SPOCK [OC]: I am not receiving, Mister Chekov. Spock to Chekov. Repeat, I am not receiving. 
SPOCK: He has the capability, Captain. 
SPOCK: Negative. 
SPOCK: Adam, there is a file on Doctor Sevrin in our computer banks. In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact 
SPOCK: That he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae. 
SPOCK: You'll also find a report from the same hospital, giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his. 
SPOCK: Adam. You know I reach you. I believe in what you seek. But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants. 
SPOCK: We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach. 
SPOCK: No, Captain, it hasn't stopped. It has gone beyond 
SPOCK: Captain, they're using 
SPOCK: (in pain) Captain, go. I. You must destroy the 
SPOCK: Ultrasonics. The panel. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. However I am picking up the shuttlecraft. 
SPOCK: It has landed. Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life at all, either humanoid nor animal. 
SPOCK: The legends were true, Captain. Fantastically beautiful planet. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: His name was Adam. 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Stand by to beam aboard injured parties. Medical team to the transporter room. 
SPOCK: Miss Galliulin. It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden. I have no doubt but that you will find it, or make it yourselves. 
SPOCK: Strange. Readings indicate a life form in the vicinity, apparently human. Yet ship's sensors indicated this planet was uninhabited. 
SPOCK: Did you say your planet, sir? 
SPOCK: Mister Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment. 
SPOCK: Are you a student of history, sir? 
SPOCK: Then you live here alone. 
SPOCK: It would seem logical to do so for the moment. 
SPOCK: This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen, and the most unique. The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period, some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century, and even a sten from Marcus Two. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. I will have a brandy. 
SPOCK: If I appear distracted, it is because of what I have seen. I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion. 
SPOCK: Envy. None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced. They are unknown works, all apparently authentic to the last brush stroke and use of materials. As undiscovered da Vinci's, they would be priceless. 
SPOCK: Most strange. A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes. Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin. 
SPOCK: Indeed. I would appreciate such a talk. It is an interest of mine. 
SPOCK: Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless. 
SPOCK: Captain. Something else which is rather extraordinary. This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms. 
SPOCK: Captain, it is written in manuscript. In original manuscript, in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise. It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet unknown. 
SPOCK: Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Since we are dependent on Mister Flint for the ryetalyn, Captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again. Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science. 
SPOCK: Strongly indicated. 
SPOCK: It does appear to defy the male logic as I understand it. 
SPOCK: We have still a greater mystery, Captain. I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mister Flint. He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities. Some body function readings are disproportionate. For one thing, extreme age is indicated on the order of six thousand years. 
SPOCK: I shall programme the readings through Doctor McCoy's medical computer when we return to the ship. 
SPOCK: We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and eighteen minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: The delay may be deliberate. 
SPOCK [on monitor]: Most interesting. Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive. It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move. 
SPOCK: Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn. 
SPOCK: Interesting. Obviously, Mister Flint is not yet ready for us to depart. 
SPOCK: The captain wanted us to wait here. 
SPOCK: Picking up tricorder readings, Captain. Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door. 
SPOCK: Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn. 
SPOCK: There may be dangers within. 
SPOCK: Let me go alone, Captain. 
SPOCK: Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mister Flint, they appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials. And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms, an unknown work in manuscript, written in modern ink. Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings. 
SPOCK: And da Vinci? 
SPOCK: How many other names shall we call you? 
SPOCK: You were born? 
SPOCK: Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition. You knew the greatest minds in history. 
SPOCK: You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman, as brilliant, as immortal as yourself. Your mate for all time. 
SPOCK: I had hoped I was wrong. 
SPOCK: We have discovered what he is, Captain. 
SPOCK: We can remain silent. 
SPOCK: What will you feel for him after we are gone? 
SPOCK: Captain, your primitive impulses will not alter the circumstances. 
SPOCK: No, you're not, for she is not. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I urge you to stop. There is a danger. 
SPOCK: She loved you, Captain. And you, too, Mister Flint, as a mentor, even as a father. There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions. She could not bear to hurt either of you. The joys of love made her human, and the agonies of love destroyed her. 
SPOCK: The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat. The Enterprise is on course five one three mark seven, as you ordered. 
SPOCK: Your report, Doctor. 
SPOCK: On that day, I shall mourn. Does he know? 
SPOCK: Indeed. 
SPOCK: Goodnight, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Forget. 
SPOCK: I still read a suggestion of carbon cycle life forms on the planet surface, Captain. 
SPOCK: Agreed. Mister Sulu, switch to the planet area I have under observation. 
SPOCK: Which would indicate a considerable civilisation there. 
SPOCK: Our readings could be false, Captain, perhaps caused by some natural phenomena. 
SPOCK: We're being scanned, Captain. A deep probe, incredibly swift. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: They did scan us and our vessel, Captain, and doubtless obtained sufficient information to present this illusion. 
SPOCK: Small change occurring there, Captain. 
SPOCK: An area of approximately one thousand square kilometres. It measures completely Earth-like. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. For a moment, it appeared almost mineral. Like living rock with heavy fore claws. It's settling down now to completely human readings. 
SPOCK: Band honours ready, Captain. 
SPOCK: We do, sir. Six hundred forty three miles, two thousand twenty one feet, two point zero four inches at this moment, using your old-style measurements. 
SPOCK: It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir. The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile. 
SPOCK: More that direction, Engineer. 
SPOCK: I am, Doctor. I am observing the alien. 
SPOCK: It would be illogical. With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel. 
SPOCK: No, I'm not, Doctor. There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose. Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this. 
SPOCK: Speculation is unnecessary, Captain. The answer is clear. President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you. What better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for you. 
SPOCK: Agreed. I, too, experienced his charm. It is a magnificent work of duplication. 
SPOCK: Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you. 
SPOCK: Captain. Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us. 
SPOCK: Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning. 
SPOCK: Surak. 
SPOCK: The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, Captain. The father of all we became. 
SPOCK: It is not logical that you are Surak. There is no fact, extrapolation of fact or theory, which would make possible. 
SPOCK: Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true. 
SPOCK: As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion. I beg forgiveness. 
SPOCK: It may be exactly as explained, Captain. Our concept of good and evil is strange to them. Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest. 
SPOCK: I'm all right, Captain. However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack. 
SPOCK: And if they're real, Captain? 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain. Logic dictates that we consider another course. 
SPOCK: His convictions are most profound in this matter, Captain. 
SPOCK: The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be. However, I too, am a Vulcan, bred to peace. Let him attempt it. 
SPOCK: I deeply respect what he has accomplished. 
SPOCK: They're trying to goad us into attacking, Captain. They expect us to act rashly. 
SPOCK: He was aware of what might happen when he went. 
SPOCK: You had no choice, Captain. You could not have stopped him. 
SPOCK: A Vulcan would not cry out so. 
SPOCK: I am not insensitive to it, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, that is what they are waiting for. They're waiting for us to attempt a rescue. 
SPOCK: No, sir. 
SPOCK: Conjecture, Captain, rather than explanation. 
SPOCK: It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired. So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter. 
SPOCK: Yes, and Surak. Perhaps in a sense they were real, Captain. Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be anything but what we expected them to be? 
SPOCK: The power source we detected is in this building, Captain. 
SPOCK: No signs of sapient life forms. 
SPOCK: Reports deny that they had any space flight capability. This appears to be an archive or library of some kind. 
SPOCK: Forgive me, sir. It is my fault. I must have miscalculated. Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all. 
SPOCK: Three hours, thirteen minutes. 
SPOCK: Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? 
SPOCK: I see. This is a fascinating machine. What is it? 
SPOCK: Interesting nomenclature. How does it work? May I 
SPOCK: Thank you, Mister Atoz. 
SPOCK: Yes, and where is the captain? 
SPOCK: Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat. 
SPOCK: Something's preventing my phaser from operating. 
SPOCK: Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you. 
SPOCK [OC]: Are you all right? 
SPOCK [OC]: Agreed. 
SPOCK: Apparently they've all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past. 
SPOCK: Indeed not. We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics. 
SPOCK: There is no library, Captain, at least not that we can see. We are at the base of an ice cliff. 
SPOCK: Just before you disappeared, Captain, I discovered a machine which Mister Atoz called the atavachron. 
SPOCK: Opening time portals to the past. You cross through into the period which you were viewing. 
SPOCK: I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same instant as Doctor McCoy. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain! 
SPOCK [OC]: You must be close to the portal. 
SPOCK: We may be in trouble ourselves. We must find shelter. 
SPOCK: In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer. 
SPOCK: We go together or not at all. 
SPOCK: We go together. 
SPOCK: He's suffering from the severity of your weather. Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I. I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time. Perhaps, if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally. It is agreeably warm here. 
SPOCK: I'm called Spock. 
SPOCK: Prisoners? 
SPOCK: Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners. We were sent here by mistake. 
SPOCK: That is true. I am not from the world you know at all. My home is a planet millions of light years away. 
SPOCK: Listen to me. I am firmly convinced that I do exist. I am substantial. You are not imagining this. 
SPOCK: McCoy. McCoy, wake up. 
SPOCK: No, we are still in the Ice Age, but safe for the moment. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you're in no condition to get up. You lie down and rest. I shall attempt to find the captain. 
SPOCK: He's our commanding officer and our friend. 
SPOCK: He did not come with us. He was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one. If I am to find him, there is only one possible avenue. Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is? 
SPOCK: Yes, that is true. If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship. He would then be marooned in this time period. But he is no longer in danger of death, so my primary duty to him has been discharged. If I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK: It should be an equation. I should be able to resolve this problem logically. Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron. If only I knew more about how it worked. Zarabeth, you said that you were brought here as a prisoner. May I ask 
SPOCK: I remember that name from the history tapes in the library. Zor Kahn the Tyrant. 
SPOCK: Zarabeth, I must return to Mister Atoz and the atavachron. We will carry Doctor McCoy, and you must come with us. I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk. 
SPOCK: You cannot go back? 
SPOCK: Come, Doctor, back to bed. 
SPOCK: It is impossible to look for him, Doctor. We cannot go back. 
SPOCK: Zarabeth explained it to me. When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure. If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor, we are trapped. Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is. 
SPOCK: Really? 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy is making excellent progress. 
SPOCK: And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Five thousand years in the future. 
SPOCK: Who knows. We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is. 
SPOCK: What was there to do? 
SPOCK: We've been through all that, Doctor. What's the point of rehashing that subject? We can't get back. Wasn't that clear to you? 
SPOCK: Then perhaps you were too ill to understand what can't get back means. 
SPOCK: Then I'll repeat it for you. Get this through your head. We can't get back. That means we are trapped here in this planet's past just as we are, and we'll stay here for the rest of our lives. Now do you understand? 
SPOCK: The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago. 
SPOCK: I don't like that. I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure. 
SPOCK: Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago. 
SPOCK: I'm sorry. I know of no way to return you to your own time. 
SPOCK: Yes. I know what it is like. 
SPOCK: If it pleases you. This is animal flesh? 
SPOCK: Naturally, because of the climate. What is the source of heat in the shelter? 
SPOCK: Excellent. Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts. Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment. 
SPOCK: But he evidently intended that you continue living. 
SPOCK: But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile. The cold must've affected me more than I realised. Please pay no attention. I'm not myself. I'm behaving disgracefully. I have eaten animal flesh and I have enjoyed it. What is wrong with me? I tell you you're beautiful. But you are beautiful. Is it so wrong to tell you so? 
SPOCK: You are beautiful. More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.
SPOCK: I've given you the facts, Doctor. 
SPOCK: You were told the truth. If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make? 
SPOCK: She would not jeopardise other lives. 
SPOCK: What are you doing to her? 
SPOCK: This is impossible. Impossible. I am a Vulcan. 
SPOCK: My ancestors are barbarians. Warlike barbarians. 
SPOCK: I've lost myself. I do not know who I am. Can we go back? 
SPOCK: There's no portal here, Doctor. It's hopeless. 
SPOCK: You're too ill to remain out here any longer. Give it up. 
SPOCK [OC]: We hear you perfectly, Captain. 
SPOCK: This must be it. 
SPOCK: You start ahead, Doctor. I do not wish to part from you. 
SPOCK: How much time do we have? 
SPOCK: There's no further need to observe me, Doctor. As you can see, I've returned to the present in every sense. 
SPOCK: Yes, it happened. But that was five thousand years ago. And she is dead now. Dead and buried. Long ago. 
SPOCK: Captain. Tricorder picking up very faint life readings. Approximately seven hundred metres from here. Help will have to be immediate. 
SPOCK: Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae. It means reversing course. 
SPOCK: May I point out that Starbase Two is on the direct route to our destination. 
SPOCK: If the diagnosis of Doctor Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her. Their medical facilities are the most primitive. 
SPOCK: Starbase Two is fully equipped and staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor. Is that not crucial to your decision? 
SPOCK: At maximum speed, Starbase Two would still meet the emergency. 
SPOCK: Sir, I believe Starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled. 
SPOCK: Since the captain usually deals with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference. 
SPOCK: Good. Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading through the ship. The crew is becoming increasingly tense. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, Doctor. The illness appears to be primarily mental. 
SPOCK: Perhaps the Surgeon General's office should be alerted. 
SPOCK: Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind? 
SPOCK: Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground. Actions such as these might be misinterpreted. 
SPOCK: Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must've taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Doctor Lester. Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light. 
SPOCK: How is the doctor? 
SPOCK: Good. I have questions to ask her. 
SPOCK: Why should he? They are my questions, therefore I am ordering it, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Has such an order ever included his senior officers? 
SPOCK: By all means, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device? 
SPOCK: To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy. 
SPOCK: That is your claim. As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests. 
SPOCK: At this moment Doctor McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes. If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence. The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: That is true. The captain did not. However, those events have been recorded. They could have become known to you. 
SPOCK: I believe you. However, my belief is not acceptable evidence. Evidence must be factual. Doctor McCoy may be of help. Come with me. 
SPOCK: He is not the captain. 
SPOCK: Certainly, Lieutenant. We all must do our duty. 
SPOCK: It's quite all right, Ensign. Everything is under control. 
SPOCK: A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir. No physical resistance will be offered. 
SPOCK: I have stated my evidence. Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T. Kirk. 
SPOCK: You've had great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness. The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation. Why, Captain? 
SPOCK: She is dangerous only to your authority, sir. 
SPOCK: The witness, sir. Bring on the witness. Let your officers put the questions. 
SPOCK: I know them now. 
SPOCK: I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position. So far. 
SPOCK: Sir, there is only one issue here. Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy. They've been witness to many strange events. They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon. 
SPOCK: Not precisely, no. 
SPOCK: I expect only to reveal the truth. 
SPOCK: And what will become of Doctor Lester? 
SPOCK: No, sir. I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made. You are not Captain Kirk. You have ruthlessly appropriated his body, but the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk. You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you. 
SPOCK [OC]: You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you. 
SPOCK: I do. And I stand by it. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her. 
SPOCK: Perhaps you were. 
SPOCK: To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack. 
SPOCK: May I point out, Captain 
SPOCK: I'm sure we all understand that, Captain. 
SPOCK: That is a very intriguing question. Scanners show no disturbances in this quadrant, Captain. 
SPOCK: Doctor, didn't the boy make any reference at all to Thasians? 
SPOCK: Charlie's very existence proves in fact there must be some intelligent form of life on Thasus. He could not possibly have survived alone. The ship's food concentrates would have been exhausted in a year or so. 
SPOCK: Probes of Thasus indicate very little edible plant life. 
SPOCK: Affirmative, Captain. 
SPOCK: Picking up some debris on our scanners, Captain. 
SPOCK: The debris is what's left of the Antares. 
SPOCK: Your mind is not on the game, Captain. Check. The Antares? 
SPOCK: My own concern is more immediate. The boy. 
SPOCK: He seemed to know what happened to the Antares before we did. 
SPOCK: And again, check. 
SPOCK: Your illogical approach to chess does have its advantages on occasion, Captain. 
SPOCK: As you wish. At any rate, the game is yours. 
SPOCK: The principles of three-dimensional chess are basically mathematic, Charlie. You put the white here and the black on the secondary level. 
SPOCK: Very well. (just three moves later) That was a mistake, Charlie. 
SPOCK: Checkmate. 
SPOCK: If you'll excuse me.&nbsp;
SPOCK: Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible. It has generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie does seems to possess this same power. 
SPOCK: Agreed. 
SPOCK: The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which would indicate a total disregard for human life. 
SPOCK: And with a weapon in him which could destroy you or anyone, anywhere on this ship. 
SPOCK: Agreed. The struggle must remain between you and him. Should any of us interfere&nbsp;
SPOCK: We're in the hands of an adolescent. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. There's a Tyger, tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night. 
SPOCK: I'm trying to Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red. 
SPOCK: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary. 
SPOCK: Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down. 
SPOCK: My legs. They're broken. 
SPOCK: I'll activate the force field myself. You can return to your section. 
SPOCK: Out of the question. 
SPOCK: Not so far as we know. 
SPOCK: Captain, the navigation console is clear now. The ship is answering the helm. 
SPOCK: Sensors show there something's there, Captain. Deflectors indicate no solid substance. 
SPOCK [OC]: Still no answer from Earth Outpost number two, Captain, and now number three's gone silent. 
SPOCK [OC]: Earth Outpost four reports they're under attack. A space vessel, identity unknown. 
SPOCK: Verified, Captain. 
SPOCK: Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond the moving position of our vessel, a line of Earth outpost stations. Constructed on asteroids, they monitor the Neutral Zone established by treaty after the Earth-Romulan conflict a century ago. 
SPOCK [OC]: As you may recall from your histories, this conflict was fought, 
SPOCK [OC]: By our standards today, with primitive atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels 
SPOCK: Which allowed no quarter, no captives. Nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication. Therefore, no human, Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other. Earth believes the Romulans to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they think of Earth. The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side, would constitute an act of war. The treaty has been unbroken since that time. Captain. 
SPOCK: Outpost two coming into sensor range, Captain. 
SPOCK: Sweeping the area of Outpost two. Sensor reading indefinite. Double-checking Outpost three. I read dust and debris. Both Earth outposts gone, and the asteroids they were constructed on, pulverised. 
SPOCK: And showing on my sensors, Captain. At least it's still there. 
SPOCK: Outpost four disintegrated, Captain. 
SPOCK: Disappeared. Interesting how they became visible for just a moment. 
SPOCK: I have a blip on the motion sensor. Could be the intruder. 
SPOCK: Invisibility is theoretically possible, Captain, with selective bending of light. But the power cost is enormous. 
SPOCK: Blip has changed its heading. And in a very leisurely manoeuvre. They may not be aware of us. 
SPOCK: His heading is now one eleven mark fourteen. The exact heading a Romulan would take, Jim, for the Neutral Zone and home. 
SPOCK: I have a fix on it, Captain. I believe I can lock on it, get a picture of their Bridge. 
SPOCK: Very well. (runs the tape through his computer) 
SPOCK: Steady on one eleven mark fourteen. Back on their original course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone. 
SPOCK: From the outpost's protective shield. Cast rodinium. This is the hardest substance known to our science. 
SPOCK: Lab theorises an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion. 
SPOCK: Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a practical invisibility screen. 
SPOCK: Or on what this vessel fails to do, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I agree. Attack. 
SPOCK: Yes, indeed we do, Mister Stiles. And if Romulans are an offshoot of my Vulcan blood, and I think this likely, then attack becomes even more imperative. 
SPOCK: It is for them, Doctor. Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive colonising period. Savage, even by Earth standards. And if Romulans retain this martial philosophy, then weakness is something we dare not show. 
SPOCK: Do you want a galactic war on your conscience? 
SPOCK: A comet, magnitude seven, dead ahead, and the intruder changing course toward it. 
SPOCK: Quite ordinary. An ionised mass, a trail of frozen vapour particles. 
SPOCK: It leaves a visible trail. 
SPOCK: Intruder now bearing directly for comet's tail. 
SPOCK: He's maintaining that bearing, Captain. 
SPOCK: We're losing sensor contact, Captain. 
SPOCK: It'll take time to correct, sir. 
SPOCK: Impossible, Captain. 
SPOCK: Phasers operational, Captain. Intruder bearing one eleven mark fourteen. 
SPOCK: He may think we're destroyed, Captain. 
SPOCK: Intruder holding steady. Course one eleven mark fourteen. 
SPOCK: They did, Doctor. 
SPOCK: We're still on our side, Captain. 
SPOCK: Motion sensor signal stopped. 
SPOCK: Vessel wreckage. Metal moulds, conduit, plastoform and a body, Captain. However. 
SPOCK: Insufficient mass, sir. 
SPOCK: Simple debris. Not a vessel, a trick. 
SPOCK: Nothing, sir. No motion out there at all. We've lost them, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil. It's giving out again. 
SPOCK: Debris on our scanners. 
SPOCK: Same type as before, sir, except, one metal-cased object! 
SPOCK: Nuclear device of some kind, sir. Our phasers detonated it less than one hundred metres away. 
SPOCK: Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts. 
SPOCK: We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and make repairs. 
SPOCK: Damage reports, Mister Stiles? 
SPOCK: Will you require assistance here? 
SPOCK: Yes, very well, thank you, Captain. 
SPOCK: I saved a trained navigator so he could return to duty. I am capable of no other feelings in such matters. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the smaller vessel is a one-man scout ship of common design. 
SPOCK: Some kind of field effect, Captain. It will hit us in precisely four seconds. It produces a most remarkable (the weapon hits) disruption. 
SPOCK: Captain, we have been hit by a kind of projected stasis field. Our matter-antimatter generators are disabled. We are paralysed. 
SPOCK: The photon torpedoes will not respond, either. The stasis field disables all higher-order field and warp functions. 
SPOCK: This new Klingon weapon must be one of surprising power if it can immobilize a starship. The energy drain on the Klingon ship would be enormous. 
SPOCK: Captain, you can't afford to lose that grain. 
SPOCK: Incredible. The amount of energy that field must require. 
SPOCK: They couldn't maintain the stasis field. 
SPOCK: Apparently their battle capacity is down. They only damaged it. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate their power cells are almost exhausted. They probably don't have the strength for a prolonged battle now. 
SPOCK: It appears to be 
SPOCK: A safe tribble would be a contradiction in terms. Tribbles are well known for their proclivities in multiplication. 
SPOCK: That may be true, but they rarely enter Federation space and fire on Federation vessels without reason. 
SPOCK: It is an energy-sapping field of great strength, Captain. It immobilizes a starship and its weapons capability. But apparently, it also immobilizes the attacking ship's abilities at the same time. 
SPOCK: I believe I just said that, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Perhaps, but there are logical applications. The key question is, how long does it take them to recharge? They will probably attack us again as soon as they are back up to power. And they will probably begin by destroying the other robot ship to prevent us from repeating the same trick. They want Cyrano Jones very badly. 
SPOCK: Captain, sensors are picking up a Klingon battle cruiser. 
SPOCK: Obviously, they can recharge their power in a matter of hours. 
SPOCK: The Klingon seems to be veering off. My mistake, Captain. They were not veering off. They were attacking the grain ship. 
SPOCK: Captain Koloth is quite a marksman. 
SPOCK: They're running away. Very odd. They did not use their stasis weapon at all. 
SPOCK: Or the purpose of the attack was something else. 
SPOCK: Captain, that could be exactly what they want us to do. Tow the robot and limit our available power. We're carrying the extra mass of the first ship's cargo, and now we have the second one in tow. That requires a great deal of power we won't be able to use in battle. 
SPOCK: Thank you. 
SPOCK: We could always throw tribbles at them. 
SPOCK: We don't, Captain. 
SPOCK: Contact in thirty seconds. 
SPOCK: Aren't you going to sit down, sir? 
SPOCK: Agreed, Captain. Tribbles appear to be a much more effective weapon. 
SPOCK: There is something else, Captain. I'm getting a reading of some kind of power from that building) 
SPOCK: Captain, the power reading now includes an electronic probe. We are being scanned. 
SPOCK: The probe originates in this wall, as does an incredibly powerful force shield. It appears to be an amalgam of devices designed to defend and protect the city and this building in particular. 
SPOCK: A moment, Captain. The results are unclear. 
SPOCK: Captain, these beings are of botanical origin. 
SPOCK: So it would seem. 
SPOCK: Your method of communication 
SPOCK: Nerve tissue. Mass density is exceptionally high. Readings indicate the beings used almost seventy percent of their brains. A very high ratio. 
SPOCK: Plant life, Captain. Primitive and aggressive. 
SPOCK: Commander Spock here. 
SPOCK: Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. Symbolising the elements that create truth and beauty. 
SPOCK: I do not believe so. 
SPOCK: To persist in this behaviour, Captain, is to negate the eloquence of your previous argument. May I suggest a more constructive way? 
SPOCK: My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts. 
SPOCK: I am pleasantly surprised at your capacity for deductive reasoning, Captain. When you are not being bellicose, there appears to be no end to your arsenal of formidable talents. 
SPOCK: And you needn't worry, Captain Kirk, about a master race. There will be no militia, no other Spocks. 
SPOCK: I would suggest Doctor Keniclius remain on Phylos with my duplicate. The concerted efforts of both scientists may yet achieve a rebirth of the Phylosian civilisation and enable them to contribute to the Federation. 
SPOCK: My thoughts exactly, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: So one might assume, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Captain, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a game. 
SPOCK: It seems, Captain, I am the only one affected. The mission, the ship, the crew, except for myself, remain the same. 
SPOCK: That is not correct. 
SPOCK: I wish to ask a question. What of Sarek's family, his wife and son? 
SPOCK: My mother. The son, what was his name and age when he died? 
SPOCK: What time period? 
SPOCK: The kahs-wan, a survival test traditional for young males. 
SPOCK: The twentieth day of Tasmeen. 
SPOCK: That was the day my cousin saved my life in the desert when I was attacked by a wild animal. 
SPOCK: I do not recall clearly. I was very young. He called himself Selek. He was visiting us, but I never saw him after that. 
SPOCK: I believe so, Captain. And I know what you're thinking. It was I who saved myself that other time. 
SPOCK: I do not remember everything. There is a vague memory from a child's point of view, but the details are not clear. 
SPOCK: Yes. I will need a Vulcan desert soft suit and boots, and a small selection of streetwear circa 8877 Vulcan years. The carry bag should be of the same period. 
SPOCK: Andorians are not known for their charity. 
SPOCK: And you in yours, Commander Thelin. 
SPOCK: I wish to visit the planet Vulcan, thirty years past, the month of Tasmeen. Location, near the city of ShirKahr. 
SPOCK: That is not true. My father 
SPOCK: In the family, all is silence. No more will be said of it. Live long and prosper, Sarek of Vulcan. 
SPOCK: My name is Selek, an humble cousin descended of T'Pel and Sasak. I am journeying to the family shrine to honour our gods. 
SPOCK: I am honoured. Is something wrong, Cousin? 
SPOCK: A family resemblance to our forefathers, no doubt. 
SPOCK: Yes, father. 
SPOCK: Yes, father. 
SPOCK: Yes, father. 
SPOCK: No, my lady Amanda. Any child has much to learn. My young cousin has a more difficult road to travel than others. 
SPOCK: It is difficult for a father to bear less than perfection in his son. Spock will find his way. 
SPOCK: The boy goes through the kahs-wan ordeal soon, does he not? 
SPOCK: But tomorrow is the twentieth day of Tasmeen. 
SPOCK: I seem to have lost track of time. 
SPOCK: What if I do, father? 
SPOCK: I-Chaya. what if I'm not a true Vulcan like they say? 
SPOCK: (dictating) Personal log, stardate 5373.9, subjective time. The timeline seems to have changed again. Yet I do not believe I have done anything to disrupt it. My memory is quite clear regarding the date my cousin saved my life, and it is tomorrow. The kahs-wan ordeal is an ancient rite of warrior days. When Vulcans turned to logic, they reasoned they must maintain the tests of courage and strength to keep pure logic from making them weak and helpless. 
SPOCK: No, I-Chaya, this is my own test. I have to do it alone. Stay. 
SPOCK: Of course. I should have remembered. It wasn't the actual kahs-wan ordeal. 
SPOCK: I-Chaya, go home. You are too old and too fat for this. (whimper) That's how you always get around mother, but it does not work with me. Go home, I-Chaya. 
SPOCK: I-Chaya, good boy. 
SPOCK: I suggest we move away from this area before the le-matya regains consciousness. 
SPOCK: Thank you for helping me and I-Chaya. 
SPOCK: It was my duty, Spock. 
SPOCK: Mother says you should always say thank you. 
SPOCK: The lady Amanda is known for her graciousness.&nbsp;
SPOCK: Do you think I'll ever be able to do that neck pinch as well as you? 
SPOCK: I dare say you will. Come now. 
SPOCK: You followed me. Why? 
SPOCK: I suspected you would go. You are worried about the kahs-wan ordeal. 
SPOCK: I had to see if I could do it. A personal test. I cannot fail. 
SPOCK: That is your father's wish? 
SPOCK: Yes, and my mother's. They, they confuse me. Father wants me to do things his way, and Mother says I should. But then she goes 
SPOCK: She is a human woman, with strong emotion and sensitivities. She embarrasses you with those traits, and you are afraid when you see them in yourself. 
SPOCK: How did you know? 
SPOCK: There is some human blood in my family line. It is not fatal. What you do not yet understand, Spock, is that Vulcans do not lack emotion. It is only that ours is controlled. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience in full. We have emotions but we deal with them and do not let them control us. 
SPOCK: I-Chaya! 
SPOCK: The le-matya struck him with its poison claws in the fight. 
SPOCK: Is he dying? 
SPOCK: Yes. 
SPOCK: We cannot get him back to the city to a healer. He is too large to move. 
SPOCK: Then what? 
SPOCK: You are a Vulcan. What is the logical thing to do? 
SPOCK: I can bring a healer here. 
SPOCK: It is a long journey across the desert. There are many dangers. I will go. 
SPOCK: No. This is my duty. No one else can do it for me. Will you stay with him? 
SPOCK: This did not happen before. My life decision was made without the sacrifice of yours, old friend. I know there is pain. I can help a little. Sleep now. 
SPOCK: Most urgent, Healer. My sehlat fought a le-matya in the Llangon foothills. He suffered a small wound, but the poison of its claws is working in him now. Please, you must come with me. He needs your healing. 
SPOCK: Yes, Healer. 
SPOCK: I did that once, two years ago. Healer, I would not call you out unless a life was in danger. Have you ever heard the son of Sarek was a liar? 
SPOCK: Healer, please hurry. 
SPOCK: It will not be long now, old friend. 
SPOCK: You made the desert crossing most efficiently. You will not disappoint Sarek in your kahs-wan. 
SPOCK: I wanted only to help I-Chaya. He was my father's before he was mine. To lose him 
SPOCK: A Vulcan would face such a loss without tears. 
SPOCK: How? 
SPOCK: By understanding every life comes to an end when time demands it. Loss of life is to be mourned but only if the life was wasted. I-Chaya's was not. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir? 
SPOCK: Is there nothing you can do? 
SPOCK: Release him. It is fitting he dies with peace and dignity. 
SPOCK: I regret having troubled you in any way, but it was necessary. 
SPOCK: There was a decision to be made. A direction for my life had to be chosen. I chose Vulcan. 
SPOCK: Thank you, father. If you will excuse me now, I have some business to conduct with schoolmates. 
SPOCK: A demonstration of the Vulcan neck pinch. Our cousin taught me. 
SPOCK: I too must make my farewells. Your hospitality has been most kind, but I must journey on. 
SPOCK: Try to understand your son, Sarek of Vulcan. It will be repayment enough for me. 
SPOCK: I think I shall not. Peace and long life. 
SPOCK: One small thing was changed this time. A pet died. 
SPOCK: It might, to some. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, you do not know your good fortune. IF the times were different, you would have to recalibrate for an Andorian. 
SPOCK: Times change, Doctor. Times change. 
SPOCK: I can only describe it as hypergravity, Captain, more powerful than any we've ever encountered. It's dragging the Enterprise toward it. 
SPOCK: Negative star mass. Spectra analysis, imploded matter, but every reading on it is negative. 
SPOCK: Impact in ninety three seconds. Ninety two. Ninety one. 
SPOCK: Forty seconds, Captain. Thirty nine, thirty eight. 
SPOCK: Nine seconds. Eight, seven. Orbital velocity. 
SPOCK: I'll need some time for the computations, Captain. 
SPOCK: Confirmed, Captain, but it isn't possible. That ship is dead. Temperature is absolute zero. There is no thermal reading to support life aboard her, and no energy store to send radio messages. Nothing except a slight magnetic flux reading which could be normal for the ship's metal. 
SPOCK: Probability point nine nine seven, Captain. 
SPOCK: Negative to both, Captain. Unknown alloy, harder and lighter than any registered metal. It is not a recorded galactic starship design. Retro analysis of the ship's spectra dates it as having been in orbit here for slightly more than three hundred million years. 
SPOCK: No, Captain, but this far from a G1 star, it is logical to assume they had some kind of warp drive. 
SPOCK: The hexagonal shape of the windows suggests a similarity to natural insect designs of Earth, the honeycombs of bees. The individual cells are shaped precisely like this. 
SPOCK: A lighter and stronger material than anything we have now. 
SPOCK: Accidents seldom have such system, Doctor McCoy. I believe we must consider the alternative possibility that the crew of this ship destroyed her themselves. 
SPOCK: Captain, its registering energy. Very little, but building. 
SPOCK: The wands are accumulators, receptors to attract energy, motion, sound, light, heat, every kind of energy around them. 
SPOCK: A physiological symptom of latent primal superstition, the fear of primitive people confronting something unknown to them. 
SPOCK: Artificial gravity is in effect here, Captain. Both air and gravity within two points of Earth normal. 
SPOCK: No use, Captain. Some sort of interference has been set up. 
SPOCK: The source of the interference is here, Captain. It's not part of the normal equipment. It's like something they jury-rigged during an emergency. 
SPOCK: Possibly from whatever had come aboard their ship. 
SPOCK: Quite right, Mister Scott. No known form of life. 
SPOCK: Something is trying to get in. The field of interference is reacting against the magnetic flux lines, Captain. 
SPOCK: If the energy stays at that level. 
SPOCK: It is possible that this much of their technology survived. (fiddling with a panel) 
SPOCK: I may be able to get a translation. 
SPOCK: Patience, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Automatic bridge defence system on and prepared, sir. 
SPOCK: We're registering a slightly higher than normal magnetic flux. Not dangerous, but the level isn't constant. It seems to fluctuate, a steady, almost pulsing rhythm. 
SPOCK: Trouble in the Engineering core, sir. 
SPOCK: Something's jammed the circuits. They're magnetised. 
SPOCK: Exactly like the Engineering controls and the life-support systems on decks five and six. 
SPOCK: Power out on all but key levels, Captain. High magnetic flux reading. 
SPOCK: It would have a very small field. 
SPOCK: It's activated, Captain, but only an area three metres square. 
SPOCK: Negative, Captain. 
SPOCK: It has absorbed the memory banks, Captain, all of them. 
SPOCK: Captain! 
SPOCK: No, Captain. 
SPOCK: I'm all right, Captain. 
SPOCK: High rank probabilities, Captain. It is a magnetic organism without mass, but capable of symbiotic relationship with a host body, a starship for instance. It is a form of primal energy, and it can utilise the electronic control systems of a starship like the mind of a man uses the neural control systems of the human body. It has become the Enterprise, and we are only life-support organisms in its body like the white corpuscles in human blood. And Captain, the magnetic flux readings are higher. It is growing stronger, building itself. 
SPOCK: The alien will know. I believe I can, Captain. I will need to aid Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Captain, this symbiont can reproduce itself by mitosis and take over every starship we encounter. It can control computer centres, whole planets. 
SPOCK: Activated, Captain. 
SPOCK: Affirmative. It fled the ship when it thought we would crash into the dead star. 
SPOCK: Yes Captain, but you may find it difficult to believe. The vessel is registered to Carter Winston. 
SPOCK: There is one person aboard who should be especially happy to learn you are alive, Mister Winston. Lieutenant Anne Nored of our security detail. 
SPOCK: We will notify her as soon as we've verified your credentials, Mister Winston. If you have your identity tapes with you 
SPOCK: I believe our regulations are quite clear, Doctor. An immediate identity check and medical examination are a standard requirement at this point. 
SPOCK: Library computer, verify record tape on Winston, Carter. 
SPOCK: Captain, the extreme long-range sensors show something in the Zone. At this distance, I cannot determine precisely what it is. It could be a trading vessel like Winston's. But it does not seem prudent to take the risk of trespass into the Zone. 
SPOCK: An admirable mission, Captain, but if we endanger our ship 
SPOCK: That has been his reputation. 
SPOCK: Is something wrong, Captain? 
SPOCK: Perhaps you needed the rest. We are on course through the Neutral Zone, sir. 
SPOCK: No, sir. You did. 
SPOCK: I believe that was the reason you gave, Captain. 
SPOCK: Perhaps Doctor McCoy should examine you, Captain. 
SPOCK: Carter Winston's? 
SPOCK: Are you sure there is no possibility you made an error? 
SPOCK: Captain, did you notice Doctor McCoy's reaction when I asked him if there was any possibility he might have made an error? 
SPOCK: There are not many places one could hide in here. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you are a man of curious habits, but I have never known you to nap on the laboratory floor. 
SPOCK: I don't think so, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I just realised that. 
SPOCK: A Vendorian, Doctor. Their planet is quarantined, and few people ever do see them. Their ability to rearrange their molecular structure into anything with the same general size and mass and their practise of deceit as a way of life puts them off limits. 
SPOCK: Spock to Bridge. Put me on ship's audio. 
SPOCK [OC]: All security teams, intruder alert. Repeat, intruder alert. The intruder is a Vendorian capable of assuming any shape or identity. 
SPOCK: Security teams report no sign of the alien on this deck, Captain. 
SPOCK: It would seem so. 
SPOCK: Direct hit, Captain. Damage to the secondary propulsion system. The commander has apparently decided to fight. 
SPOCK: Practicality does suggest capitulation, Captain. 
SPOCK: Second vessel firing now, sir. 
SPOCK: Strange. We did no damage, but the Romulan is retreating anyway. 
SPOCK: Second vessel power supply out. Crew unharmed. They should be able to repair the ship in a few days. 
SPOCK: Interesting. 
SPOCK: It is not outside the realm of probability. If he could rearrange his own atoms to become an examination table, one would have to assume he could become a deflector shield. 
SPOCK: Your deflector shield, Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: Acute observation, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Perhaps. But then two Doctor McCoys just might bring the level of medical efficiency on this ship up to acceptable levels. 
SPOCK: If my calculations are correct, Captain, we have twenty seconds to go. 
SPOCK: Five seconds. Four, three 
SPOCK: Captain, we are being probed. 
SPOCK: The signal is coming from a star system twenty light years away. 
SPOCK: It is the Taurean system. A small star at the extreme edge of this sector. 
SPOCK: It does resemble a summons. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Like a Vulcan marriage drum. I am experiencing audio-visual suggestion, Captain. 
SPOCK: Logically, we must assume they are created by the probe. 
SPOCK: Readings are still inconclusive. It is odd that only the men are affected, Captain. I suggest 
SPOCK: Captain, the urgency of our feeling suggests visual compulsion. I advise remaining at a distance until I can determine the extent of its influence. The life forms are indicated in its centre. 
SPOCK: The form is humanoid, but there are many internal differences. Their bodies appear to function on an unusual psychokinesis level. 
SPOCK: Tonal control. Fascinating. 
SPOCK: We must return to our duties aboard ship. 
SPOCK: Yes. Your medikit, Doctor. It may contain something which will help us. 
SPOCK: Perhaps they saw no practical use in it. 
SPOCK: (with a medical scanner) If the lock is magnetised, this may disrupt its field. 
SPOCK: I have noticed that their glow diminishes when the women are not present. They could be polarised conductors which transfer our vital energy to the bodies of the women. 
SPOCK: That would account for our rapid aging, Captain. And our weakness. If you recall, the women seemed listless at first. But as our strength has failed, they have become more energetic and vital. 
SPOCK: We seem to be aging ten years per day, Captain. 
SPOCK: I have retained more strength than any of you. My internal structure is different, Captain, my life span longer. It is wiser if I go to the temple to try and find the communicators and contact the ship. 
SPOCK: The equipment belonging to the men of the Enterprise, where is it? 
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. 
SPOCK: Request rescue party. All-female. Repeat. All-female. All 
SPOCK [OC]: Miss Chapel. Miss Chapel. 
SPOCK [OC]: Christine. 
SPOCK: Instruct female engineer to divert ship's energy into deflector shields. Block probe. 
SPOCK: Use all ship's energy. Everything channelled to the shields. Hurry, Christine. 
SPOCK: Perhaps the transporter is the key. 
SPOCK: Our restoration. It holds the molecular pattern of our original bodies when we beamed down to the planet. 
SPOCK: Possibly. But the odds against us are ninety nine point seven to one. 
SPOCK: We are on the surface, Mister Scott. Reprogram the transporter as previously directed. 
SPOCK: Captain, we are now approaching sensor range of the cloud. 
SPOCK: It seems to be of irregular shape, some eight hundred thousand kilometres across and about half that in depth. 
SPOCK: This is very curious, Captain. It computes as a strange combination of matter and energy. 
SPOCK: No, Lieutenant, the cloud has engulfed Alondra. Captain, the planet seems to be breaking up. Its mass is definitely growing smaller. 
SPOCK: It seems a logical assumption, Captain. 
SPOCK: Perhaps more, Doctor. If planet annihilation is part of this thing's nature, it might seek them out as instinctively as an amoeba seeks out food. It may not consume only planets, but also stars. We do not know yet whether it has any selective ability, but it could be a thread to every planet in our galaxy. 
SPOCK: On the other hand, notifying them may still save some small fraction of the population, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, I'm getting unusual readings on the chemical identity sensors. 
SPOCK: Elements unknown in our periodic tables, Captain. I'm of the opinion this cloud has come from outside our galaxy. 
SPOCK: The streamers are a combination of koinoenergy, almost an ambiplasma with an unusually powerful attraction force. 
SPOCK: The cloud appeared to absorb the phaser energy, Captain. 
SPOCK: The objects are some form of highly charged gaseous antimatter. 
SPOCK: Only the beginning of a theory, Captain. It is possible this cloud in which we are entrapped is a living thing. The cloud is alive. Yes, Captain, its components appear similar to those found in living organisms. 
SPOCK: I am inclined to agree with the Doctor, Captain. The mass of the planet Alondra has been steadily growing smaller since we've been in here. 
SPOCK: If we assume the cloud is a living being, we must also assume it needs some kind of food to sustain itself. 
SPOCK: Exactly. It is like a huge bull grazing here and there in the pasture of the universe. 
SPOCK: Captain, those villi are antimatter. It the Enterprise touches one of them 
SPOCK: The cloud is now only forty two minutes, fourteen seconds from Mantilles, Captain. And we have ascertained an important fact. This being does have a brain. 
SPOCK: Impossible to say at this moment, Captain. It has made only one action which might be interpreted as intelligent. It changed course from Alondra toward Mantilles. But that could have been an involuntary response to the sensing of food. 
SPOCK: That irregularly shaped object at the top of the core emanates considerable electrical activity. 
SPOCK: Captain, this is a living creature. Starfleet regulations 
SPOCK: Captain, I have completed the analysis of the target area. Unfortunately, the brain is so vast, our entire offensive armament will not assure its destruction. However, the brain could be completely destroyed if we convert the entire ship to energy, aimed at the brain's cortex, and expend the energy in one mortal strike. 
SPOCK: I believe that is what I just said, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Quite sure. 
SPOCK: It would require physical contact, which is impossible, Captain. But I may be able to reach out with my mind. If we focus our sensors onto the cloud's synaptic electrical impulses, the input could be routed to the ship's computer for analysis into thought. 
SPOCK: It is impossible to calculate, Captain. There are too many unknown factors. I can only try to accomplish the link. No more. 
SPOCK: Ready, Captain. [OC] Listen to me. Listen to me. You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. 
SPOCK [OC]: You are not alone here, there is someone else. Listen to me. Listen to me. 
SPOCK [OC]: I am another being. 
SPOCK [OC]: I am inside you. 
SPOCK [OC]: I am very small. And there are many of me. We are in a spaceship within you. 
SPOCK [OC]: A small thing which holds us all. 
SPOCK [OC]: Within you. 
SPOCK [OC]: We came to think to you. You consumed us. You thought we were food. 
SPOCK [OC]: Many of us live on the things you consume. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes. Many of us are on the thing near you now. Do not consume it. 
SPOCK [OC]: The spherical thing ahead of you, the matter you intend to consume, sense it closely. 
SPOCK [OC]: They are beings. Alive, like you. They will all die if you consume that thing. 
SPOCK [OC]: Explain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Listen to me. I'm going to come into your thoughts. And at the same time, you will come into mine. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes. Very. 
SPOCK [OC]: There are many things in our galaxy like the one you just perceived. 
SPOCK [OC]: Truth. You do not desire to consume other beings. It would be best if you return to your origin. The way you came. Will you do this? 
SPOCK [OC]: Will you return? 
SPOCK: I believe so, Captain. There is a grid at the top of the brain core. It uses it to sense. We can escape the cloud through it. 
SPOCK: The wonders of the universe, Captain. Incredible, completely incredible. 
SPOCK: The probability of his presence on Motherlode is eight one percent plus or minus point five three. 
SPOCK: I just did, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Are you aware that Harry Mudd is tricking you via an illusion? 
SPOCK: The so-called girl is a Rigelian hypnoid, projecting a simple illusion. 
SPOCK: Stole a spaceship. 
SPOCK: A fraud. But sold for enough credits to get to Sirius Nine. 
SPOCK I shall require a medical report on the prisoner, Miss Chapel. 
SPOCK: You exaggerate, Nurse. Kindly see that your medical summary is more precise. 
SPOCK: Binary sun with a Class M planet. That's rare enough to warrant investigation. 
SPOCK: No evidence of intelligent life. Atmosphere at surface, eight hundred millibars, breathable. Gravity one point two. Temperature hot, but within Class M limits. 
SPOCK: Yes, Nurse? 
SPOCK: Are you injured, Miss Chapel? 
SPOCK: Perfectly normal. I will append your summary to the report. Was there something else, Miss Chapel? 
SPOCK: That would be illogical, Miss Chapel. 
SPOCK: And appended hereto is a medical summary by Nurse Christine Chapel. Ah, Nurse Chapel's sweet summary. Dear, lovely Christine. 
SPOCK: Captain. Doctor. I wish to report a, er, a number of very strange, um, emotions. 
SPOCK: Mudd. And he has Christine. She's in danger. My love. 
SPOCK: No. Not with my Christine. 
SPOCK: We must go after them, Captain. I'll lead a landing party. 
SPOCK: Captain, I insist upon going. Christine. I can't stand the thought of any danger to her, to the woman I love. 
SPOCK: Yes. I want to protect her, hold her in my arms. 
SPOCK: Good. 
SPOCK: Come on. Hurry! If he's harmed one hair on her pretty head 
SPOCK: Please, Captain. 
SPOCK: Thanks Jim. It's good to have a friend like you. 
SPOCK: Darling, are you all right? 
SPOCK: Don't worry. You'll be safe, darling. 
SPOCK: That's my affair. 
SPOCK: Jim. No. Captain. We're both reacting to the drug. The love potion. 
SPOCK: That is an outstandingly stupid idea. I'm sorry. The drug. I simply doubt that we can appeal to their better nature. If they have one. 
SPOCK: May I help you record his confession, Nurse? 
SPOCK: A few moments of love, paid for with several hours of hatred. Your potion is scarcely a bargain, Harry. 
SPOCK: I can guarantee it. 
SPOCK: If we do, Captain, we may also encounter forces and phenomena beyond our understanding. 
SPOCK: An extraordinary phenomenon, Captain. 
SPOCK: Charting scanners on, Captain. Beginning science survey. 
SPOCK: Scanners indicate it's some form of matter-energy whirlwind, Captain. 
SPOCK: There may be only one choice. We must hope this whirlwind is like its atmospheric counterparts, that there is calm at its centre. 
SPOCK: Allow me. 
SPOCK: An incredible experience, Captain. I find this scientifically fascinating. 
SPOCK: Through the centre of things, Doctor. Through what may be the centre of everything. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid our navigational co-ordinates mean very little here, Lieutenant. My readings indicate we are not in time and space as we understand it. Doctor, these readings may interest you. 
SPOCK: Apparently, the natural laws of our universe don't operate here, Captain. 
SPOCK: It cannot. It is not logical. 
SPOCK: I find this all quite absorbing, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Of course. Our Federation scientists were more correct than they realised. In order to function, the galactic creation point must extend through space, time, into another dimension where the logic of things is totally different. 
SPOCK: If Lucien put it there, Captain, the questions become, why is he hiding us, and, what is our danger if discovered by the rest of his people? 
SPOCK: (drawing a pentangle on the floor) I believe this is how the ancients used to draw their mystic symbols, Captain. 
SPOCK: One uses the resources at hand, Captain. Watch now. (stands in the pentangle) I will attempt to move a Vulcan chess piece magically. May the energy of this universe be the power in me. 
SPOCK: It must work, Doctor. It is logical here. Power of this universe, enter my being. I know I can. I believe I can. 
SPOCK: Approximately 1691, Captain. Salem Massachusetts, if I recall your historical records correctly. 
SPOCK: But you made mistakes, used your powers 
SPOCK: I will, Asmodeus. I am not of Earth. 
SPOCK: I call Lucien as my first witness. 
SPOCK: Lucien, you alone of all those here do not seem to fear or hate humans. Why? 
SPOCK: Thank you, Lucien. Next witness, please. Captain James T Kirk. 
SPOCK: Tell the court, please, Captain Kirk. Would you say that since Salem, humans have changed? 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. Could you elaborate? 
SPOCK: Captain, use the magic you know. Believe. 
SPOCK: I see. The Megans had to have proof that mankind had grown and learned wisdom since they last saw Earth. Your compassion was that proof, Captain. 
SPOCK: It just might, Captain. If he was, this would be the second time Lucifer was cast out, and thanks to you, the first time he was saved. 
SPOCK: Our sensors are in a state of chaos, Captain. They became unreliable when we entered the Triangle. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: I can offer none at this time. However, the Klingon ship was not destroyed by our phaser fire. Its shields clearly deflected the phasers. Nor was its disappearance the type that would have been affected if it were using its cloaking device. 
SPOCK: The sensors are still not registering normally, sir. But I would venture the theory it has something to do with the many ship disappearances in this area. 
SPOCK: Tactically well planned. When the Federation investigates, we'll be recorded as just another mysterious starship disappearance. 
SPOCK: Sir, we seem to be suffering from some form of vertigo. 
SPOCK: Captain, on the viewscreen. 
SPOCK: Your logic is excellent, Captain. There is a random factor to the ship disappearances. Perhaps the touching of the two time continuums is erratic. In any event, the window stayed open long enough for us to follow the Klothos in. 
SPOCK: Sensor scans give a rough approximation of the age of the metal in the hulls, Captain. Some of them have been here for centuries. 
SPOCK: The crew's descendants may still be living, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes. I am picking up life and energy readings from the cluster of ships ahead of us. 
SPOCK: If we find an answer, it will still take time. 
SPOCK: Impossible to predict, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Several times, Captain. I do not wish to surrender hope, but the facts remain unchangeable. 
SPOCK: I do not believe they can, sir. High rank probability. Their S2 graf unit, which is roughly the equivalent of our warp drive, began giving off depleted energy readings. Kor decided to try to bluff it through. 
SPOCK: Their attempt has given me an idea as to how we may be able to break through the time barrier. 
SPOCK: I cannot tell you how impressed I am by your splendid spirit of co-operation. 
SPOCK: Forgive me, Commander. I was overcome by the moment. Goodbye. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, I'm sure there has been a mistake. (hands on shoulders) Where are you supposed to be working? 
SPOCK: Captain, allow me to escort this young man to his work area. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Why do you ask? 
SPOCK: I believe there is, Captain. But not within me. I sensed something strange about the Klingons when we were aboard the Klothos. They were too agreeable, too willing to co-operate. 
SPOCK: Had I not touched them, I would have agreed with you, Captain. But even though contact was necessarily limited and their minds were suspicious, I picked up some indication they are planning to sabotage the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: I cannot say. The Klingon found near the dilithium vault knew nothing specific. But there is some kind of sabotage in the offing. 
SPOCK: These stasis boxes are the most remarkable thing the Slavers ever produced. Time stands still inside a stasis box. A billion years means nothing in there. What is it, Lieutenant? 
SPOCK: The Slavers and all their subjects were exterminated in the war that followed. Intelligent life had to evolve all over again. The stasis boxes are the only remnant of those lost civilisations. 
SPOCK: Mister Sulu, what is our position? 
SPOCK: Most peculiar. This indicates there is another stasis box circling Beta Lyrae. 
SPOCK: It would be most illogical that a stasis box would remain here undiscovered for so long. Beta Lyrae is one of the rare spectacles of the galaxy. Almost every ship that passes stops to see it. 
SPOCK: Possible. The only known stasis box detector is another stasis box. Still. Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Bring us about. We'll investigate the Beta Lyrae system. 
SPOCK [OC]: Stasis boxes and their contents are the only remnant of a species which ruled most of this galaxy a billion years ago. Their effect on science has been incalculable. In one was found a flying belt which was the key to the artificial gravity field used by starships. Another box contained a disrupter bomb with the pin pulled. As a result, all stasis boxes are now under the jurisdiction of Starfleet, and only certain key specialists handle them. The boxes are rare, potentially dangerous, and we seem to have found a second one. 
SPOCK: We are not tourists here, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: As with a number of discoveries, purely by accident, Lieutenant. The other box seems to be almost under us, perhaps thirty metres below the ice. 
SPOCK [OC]: I must take full responsibility for this event. Instead of being warned by the highly unlikely coincidence of a second stasis box, I allowed it's possible value to influence my judgement. The Kzinti now possess our stasis box. Its contents will determine how much damage my error has done the Federation and its people. 
SPOCK: A Kzinti spacecraft. 
SPOCK: The Treaty of Sirius does not permit them any weapons at all, beyond police vessels. Obviously, the treaty has been broken. 
SPOCK: The lean, be-draggles one is a reader of minds. 
SPOCK: There is no sure way to guard our thoughts from him. Mister Sulu, he is not likely to deal with me or Lieutenant Uhura. She and I are inferior beings to them. But the Kzinti are meat eaters. If you sense him reading your mind, think of eating a raw vegetable. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura. This may be crucial. In the presence of the Kzinti, do not say anything, do not do anything startling. Try to look harmless. 
SPOCK: Are you forgetting Kzinti females are dumb animals? In an emergency the Kzinti may forget a human female is an intelligent creature. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant, I value your intelligence, but we may be able to seize an opportunity to escape if the Kzinti believe you have none. 
SPOCK: If so, it is the first ever discovered. An important historical find. 
SPOCK: We are fortunate none of the settings so far have been superior to the technology now available to the Federation. 
SPOCK: The fifth setting seems to be an energy absorber. Fascinating. I had no idea the Slavers had such things. 
SPOCK: Yes. When I give the word, make for the shuttle. Remember to zigzag. Ready? Go. 
SPOCK: I have the weapon. 
SPOCK: No, they cannot. Or rather, will not. 
SPOCK: Because I kicked Chuft-Captain. Consider. Chuft-Captain has been attacked by an herbivorous pacifist, an eater of leaves and roots. One who traditionally does not fight. And the ultimate insult, I left him alive. Chuft-Captain's honour is at stake. He must seek personal revenge before he can call for help. 
SPOCK: Of course. 
SPOCK: Agreed. However, to this point, we have not seen anything more powerful than equipment Starfleet already has. 
SPOCK: I acknowledge your expertise in the field of weapons, Mister Sulu, but I do not see how you can determine probable ownership. 
SPOCK: Assuming it's a spy weapon then, the Slavers would have wanted to keep it a secret weapon. If so, it is logical to assume it has a self-destruct setting too. 
SPOCK: Perhaps not. There is the null setting. It seems to do nothing. But why should it be there? It does not correspond to a safety lock. 
SPOCK: Answer him, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Kzinti ribs have some vertical bracing. But I kicked him over one heart. I compute the odds of my defeating Chuft-Captain in combat at sixteen to one against. 
SPOCK: A self-destruct mechanism would not have a gun sight. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. No world in the Federation has produced anything so powerful. Almost beyond theoretical limits. Total conversion of matter to energy at a distance. 
SPOCK: There is a grid. It may be another communications device. But that seems redundant. 
SPOCK: The Kzinti have legends of weapons haunted by their owners. 
SPOCK: No, it appears to be conversing with them. A reasoning computer that small? 
SPOCK: Most peculiar. 
SPOCK: That was not the total conversion beam setting. 
SPOCK: They are not about to get it, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Assume you are a Slaver war computer. You've been turned off. You do not know for how long, but when you were turned off, there was a war on. Now you are awakened by aliens you never saw before. They do not know any of the military passwords. They ask you so many questions it is obvious they know little about you. Your owner is nowhere about. What would you think? 
SPOCK: Activate life support belts. 
SPOCK: Yes. Another conventional weapon. It appears the total conversion beam was the only thing the Slavers had that we do not. 
SPOCK: It never would have reached the museum, Lieutenant. There was too much power in that one setting. If not the Kzinti, the Klingons or some other species would have tried to possess it. 
SPOCK: Strange, how the past sometimes breaks through into the present. That ancient war could have sparked a new war between man and Kzinti. 
SPOCK: Yes, an ancient superstition. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. The others are mere outcroppings. They suggest the peaks of submerged mountains. 
SPOCK: For once I agree with you, Doctor. The more informative specimens will come from the sea bottom. 
SPOCK: Firing, Captain. 
SPOCK: Apparently a life form which previous surveys have not recorded. 
SPOCK: Its skeleton is similar to that of a Denebian whale, Captain. 
SPOCK: Phasers do not respond, Captain. We must have sustained damage to the power pack when the creature struck us. 
SPOCK: That implies there are intelligent life forms on Argo. 
SPOCK: They did fail to indicate the large marine creature that attacked us. Perhaps the readings are incomplete, blocked by underwater pressure forces. Oceans are less turbulent at greater depth. Such conditions would be more suitable to intelligent forms. 
SPOCK: The Captain states the case emotionally, of course, but correctly. I would be of little value to this ship if I am confined to a tank in Sickbay. I must accompany the Captain. 
SPOCK: I believe the phrase was, 'our young saved your lives once.' 
SPOCK: I would say so, Captain. The instinctive reaction of all frightened creatures is to retreat to a place of safety. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. And beautiful. 
SPOCK: It is quite possible, Captain, that they find us grotesque and ugly. And many people fear beings different from themselves. 
SPOCK: Perhaps there is a way open on the far side. There is much less activity there. 
SPOCK: We came here in peace, Tribune. 
SPOCK: Not on this world. 
SPOCK: You are mistaken, sir. Our only purpose here is to find the means of reversing our mutations. 
SPOCK: That suggests your race evolved from its ancient enemies. 
SPOCK: Apparently they were exposed to a frightening geological disaster. Such hardship induces savagery and violence. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Obviously, an entire portion of the continental shelf sank within a few minutes. This may be the sealed place Rila mentioned. I believe this is an entrance panel, Captain. 
SPOCK: This resembles ancient medical symbols, Captain. The torso indicates mutation. 
SPOCK: We cannot reverse our mutations without the serum, nor can the Aquans benefit from the knowledge of their ancestors. 
SPOCK: Confirmed, sir. 
SPOCK: Sensors indicate the epicentre of the quake was in the north polar seas, Captain, a totally uninhabited area. 
SPOCK: The seabed should stabilize within a few hours. 
SPOCK: Argo appears to have a new city, Captain, or rather, one reborn. 
SPOCK: Our experience here has shown us the means of diverting quakes. That will mean much to the endangered Federation planet. 
SPOCK: It is a very real threat. In two standard years, the existing Skorr could breed an army of two hundred billion warriors. 
SPOCK: Is there any clue to its location? 
SPOCK: That is to be expected. The surface of this planet shifts constantly. Even the Vedala are not certain where the Soul is. 
SPOCK: Our direction is indicated. 
SPOCK: The Vedala would not have chosen Lara if her abilities were less than perfect. 
SPOCK: The Vedala will have been efficient in equipping us. I will acquaint myself with our supplies. 
SPOCK: I have checked the supplies, Captain. As expected, they are adequate and there are weapons. 
SPOCK: But there is, Captain. Ourselves. And there may be other things guarding the Soul of Alar.
SPOCK: A statistical probability. 
SPOCK: Yes. But philosophy and poetry are not appropriate here. 
SPOCK: A lava flow. Volcanic action is to be expected. 
SPOCK: Such a diversion would be of short duration, Captain. And I must point out, the vehicle lacks sufficient speed to escape. 
SPOCK: It is possible, but the rewiring of the power leads is complex and time-consuming. 
SPOCK: Yes, quickly then. Terminal M3 red, lead to diode shunt A37. Cross connect to A14. 
SPOCK: Carefully, Em. One missed connection could destroy us. 
SPOCK: It's re-rigged. Hurry. 
SPOCK: Leave, all of you. 
SPOCK: Captain, you must get the others away. 
SPOCK: Far too close, Captain. I appreciate your action on my behalf, but your first duty is to the group and the mission. 
SPOCK: There is no life on this planet. 
SPOCK: Sord, what did you think you saw back there? 
SPOCK: There should be no life on this planet. 
SPOCK: Yes. The Vedala would have informed us if there were any live beings here we should know of. 
SPOCK: That is an impossibility. 
SPOCK: Is this not the shape of your people's primitive temples? 
SPOCK: The Vedala were right. There are no living creatures here, only the mechanised sentinels. 
SPOCK: I too would prefer to press on, Captain. The mechanicals on guard may be what Sord saw tracking us earlier. Or there may be others. In either case, it would be more advantageous to avoid another encounter. 
SPOCK: The walls are not climbable. 
SPOCK: You suggest sabotage, Captain? 
SPOCK: Approximately eighty two point five percent in favour of the possibility. 
SPOCK: The planet is geologically unstable. This structure is inherently flexible, enabling it to withstand earthquakes. 
SPOCK: It is locked in a force field. Your rope would merely bounce off it. 
SPOCK: I cannot define the field's energy base, Captain, but 
SPOCK: Most of them will be killed. The warrior races of the Federation will rise up to battle the Skorr. 
SPOCK: Last week with you, Captain. 
SPOCK: How long were we gone? 
SPOCK: Arachna is entering its cycle of strongest emissions, Captain. 
SPOCK: Signals appear random. Perhaps some are beyond our reception capability. 
SPOCK: Correction. One isolated word pattern detected. If you accept intersat code as still operative. 
SPOCK: The code word is t-e-r-r-a-t-i-n. 
SPOCK: Computers show no immediate information on the word terratin. 
SPOCK: No, sir. It was repeated twice in the transmission. 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Only data is from early exploration. Planet is listed as Class M, core molten, mantle and crust entirely crystalline. 
SPOCK: I register a disturbance, Captain. As if an impulse just passed through the ship. 
SPOCK: Unidentified. It's extremely faint and diffused. Captain, I suggest we delay orbit until it can be analysed for nature and effect. 
SPOCK: Wave bombardment reduced, but continuing. Deflector shields ineffective. 
SPOCK: Captain, this is quite unprecedented. Notice the fracturing is spiro-form, similar to long chain molecules. 
SPOCK: I have never slumped in my life, Captain, but I was about to ask you the same 
SPOCK: An equally good possibility is that ship's personnel have contracted, and may be continuing to shrink. 
SPOCK: Only that it is complex beyond anything in my experience. 
SPOCK: Agreed. And it is accelerating. 
SPOCK: Ad infinitum, perhaps, considering distance between atoms is relatively as great as between stars. 
SPOCK: Miss Chapel, what is the composition of this decoration? 
SPOCK: Yet the uniform on which you wear it fits as well as ever. Uniform made of algae-based xenylon, I believe. 
SPOCK: This coral decoration for the aquarium is also shrinking. yet the meteoritic rock in there is unchanged. 
SPOCK: The wave tends to wind tight such spiral molecules as dilithium. There is one other molecular structure 
SPOCK: It's possible. I'll feed the data into the computer banks. 
SPOCK: The computer will project the point at which systems' switches and buttons will be beyond our ability to operate. 
SPOCK: No information on that as yet, sir. I do have one read-out on full spiroid wave analysis. That will take approximately eight years. 
SPOCK: Results on DNA reduction limits have come through, Captain. 
SPOCK: Factor of thirty two point nine. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Well past the operative point of Enterprise controls. 
SPOCK: Easily, Captain. May I ask the purpose? 
SPOCK: This is the best I could do in rigging so small a communicator, sir. 
SPOCK: It's range cannot be guaranteed. How will we pinpoint you for return in case it fails? 
SPOCK: Captain, the transporter retains a memory of the body's molecular structure. Will it apply as well to your present height? 
SPOCK: Good luck, sir. 
SPOCK [OC]: We read you, Captain. Wave bombardment has just ceased. 
SPOCK: Descendants of an early lost colony, which is why they retain some knowledge of starship methods such as transporter mechanisms. These Earth colonists named and numbered this planet Terra Ten. 
SPOCK [OC]: Hence the present corruption of their name. 
SPOCK: Exactly why they were lost, Captain. Spirod epsilon waves are natural here, and shrank them to this size. It has become a genetic characteristic now. 
SPOCK: Energise, Captain. 
SPOCK: The Terratins are making available all possible dilithium. The crystals are small, but I believe they will provide enough power until we can obtain larger pieces. 
SPOCK: Captain, what about the people on the planet? 
SPOCK: We came rather close to making it more than honorary. 
SPOCK: A capability, I'm afraid, out of the reach of most humans. 
SPOCK: It's a class M planet, gravity Earth normal, atmosphere Earth normal. There is no previous information available except that which the survey ship logged before her crew left her. 
SPOCK: Five weeks, three days, two hours and four minutes to be exact, Captain. 
SPOCK: It certainly can support life forms. But I cannot speculate on what type without further data. Mister Arex is conducting a sensor scan now. 
SPOCK: Logical, Captain. 
SPOCK: Unusual that such a lake would exist under these planetary conditions. 
SPOCK: Most remarkable. 
SPOCK: There could be many reasons why we did not. 
SPOCK: It seems to gather strength from our phasers. In my opinion. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: I am undamaged. Where is Doctor McCoy? 
SPOCK: It would appear a more logical solution is in order, Captain. We don't lift the tail off, we dig the Doctor out. 
SPOCK: One point one kilometres, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, the beast, did it seem familiar to you? 
SPOCK: You propose the same environment necessarily prompts the same evolution? 
SPOCK: Doctor, your lack of scientific interest is amazing. 
SPOCK: Captain, doesn't it strike you strange that two such different ecologies could co-exist so closely? 
SPOCK: Merely an observation, Captain. 
SPOCK: Apparently alive. We cannot be sure. 
SPOCK: Allow me to test the water first, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Captain, the water is too pure. 
SPOCK: Nonetheless, it is too pure. 
SPOCK: Correct, Captain. And a rain forest this close to a desert is also illogical. It is my theory that what we have seen since we landed was manufactured, not created. 
SPOCK: Unless, of course, the random choice is the pattern. 
SPOCK: I thought I just did, Doctor. 
SPOCK: The desperation of the science ship's first landing party is now obvious. 
SPOCK: However, not exactly safe. 
SPOCK: By observation alone, it appears they hit an invisible force field. 
SPOCK: Captain, there it is. 
SPOCK: If these are the builders, it is an admirable feat. 
SPOCK: Perhaps not in a way we understand. I keep receiving impressions. 
SPOCK: Congratulations, Doctor. A most logical assumption. 
SPOCK: A wasteful use of energy, Doctor. I believe they can hear you without your shouting. 
SPOCK: I've come to the conclusion they are, Captain. But the speed at which the thoughts flow is too great for me to comprehend except for the most fleeting image. 
SPOCK: They appear to be as advanced beyond Earth civilisation as you are from a colony of ants. 
SPOCK: You will recall we recognised at least two species from vastly different planets. The environment did not appear natural to this planet. A technology this advanced could easily travel to other star systems to collect specimens. 
SPOCK: Exactly. 
SPOCK: Not necessarily, Captain. They could have taken them for the same reason you would take a sharp object away from a child. 
SPOCK: That too is a possibility. 
SPOCK: I find them strangely attractive. 
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. This area has been carefully prepared for human types. The aliens are safe now. 
SPOCK: They are safe because we are now exhibits in a zoo. 
SPOCK: Where do they keep the equipment? I could use my tricorder. 
SPOCK: Have you tried to communicate? 
SPOCK: Yes, sir. I can't seem to get through, Captain. They appear too involved with each other. 
SPOCK: My impression is that they are laughing at me. 
SPOCK: Animals in a zoo rarely do. 
SPOCK: Captain, they are highly intelligent. I'm sure they are quite aware of the purpose of each piece of equipment now. 
SPOCK: Then think about it that way, Doctor. 
SPOCK: I suggest we all concentrate on the medical kit. 
SPOCK: A natural reaction for the curators of a zoo. 
SPOCK: Begging your pardon, Captain, I think we should face the situation realistically. We are specimen animals in a zoo. And they have taken every precaution to prevent our escape. To them we are caged for life. We seem to be drawing quite a crowd. 
SPOCK: To a degree, with our own species and with some others, but the Lactran intelligence is eons beyond mine. 
SPOCK: About as much as a mother learns from a six month old infant. 
SPOCK: We seem to frighten the smaller ones. Some, the females, I believe, find us quite ugly. 
SPOCK: A wise move, Captain. From what I can gather, even the Enterprise is no match for their force field. 
SPOCK: If I may suggest, sir? 
SPOCK: It is obvious they can pick up specific thought transmissions from us if they care to go to the trouble. I suggest that one of our number appear to be ill. The rest will put strong thoughts in our minds that a communicator is needed for recovery. 
SPOCK: The communicator, concentrate on the communicator. 
SPOCK: I'm receiving an impression they are worried about their child, Captain. 
SPOCK: They seem to think you made the child disappear. They did not know we were a deadly species, capable of injuring one of them. 
SPOCK: Captain, fight it. Fight it as hard as you can. They think too fast in too complex a manner. If he gives up for even one moment, he may go mad. 
SPOCK: Captain, they have concluded they cannot break through your mind on a one to one basis. They are now gathering the mental strength of all five of them to break through. 
SPOCK: Everybody, concentrate on Captain Kirk. Form a thought screen. 
SPOCK: You made contact? 
SPOCK: They're trying to contact us directly. I can make out something. It's, it's difficult, they think so fast. But the child has learned and told its parents all about the Federation and the races it encompasses. 
SPOCK: We are considered simplistic, but in the process of evolving into a higher order. 
SPOCK: Yes, even Vulcans? 
SPOCK: Exactly, sir. It seems they were where we are some tens of thousands of centuries ago. Their centuries, not ours. 
SPOCK: It appears so. They do not feel we belong in their zoo. 
SPOCK: There will be other opportunities, Mister Markel. I have just received their final telepathic message. 
SPOCK: We'll be welcome back, in twenty or thirty centuries. 
SPOCK: Theirs. And it will take me some time to figure out how long that is. 
SPOCK: The Queen of Hearts and her cards are characters from Alice Through the Looking Glass, Captain. 
SPOCK: Light reading is considered relaxing, Captain. My mother was particularly fond of Lewis Carroll's work. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: Nothing, Captain. Lieutenant Uhura is not in the general beam-down area. 
SPOCK: Presumably they would be adjacent to the computer centre that operates the planetary effects. 
SPOCK: The underground complex is shielded by a combination of granite and metal alloy and the sensors will not penetrate. 
SPOCK: Tricorder readings confirm a solid shell of granite and metal alloy, Captain. 
SPOCK: They are all malfunctioning, Captain. Some kind of electronic block has cut us off from the ship. 
SPOCK: An astute medical observation, Doctor, if we can believe this information. Tricorder readings indicate there is a body interred here. 
SPOCK: Captain, signs pointing the way. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. Mechanical manifestations, of course. Was anyone considering the subject of pterodactyls? 
SPOCK: Our amusement park no longer seems content to amuse. 
SPOCK: It's quite real, Doctor. Watch out for the claws. I think it prudent to remember that on this planet, anything we think may be used against us. We must monitor our thoughts and give our enemy no more ammunition. 
SPOCK: May I suggest, Captain, that we might find some of the answers we're after without leaving the safety of this cave. 
SPOCK: I believe you may know the answer to that, Doctor. 
SPOCK: During the Enterprise's last visit here, Doctor McCoy was mortally wounded. Correct? 
SPOCK: Since the planet's power source is underground, it seems only logical that Doctor McCoy was somehow transported there and repaired. 
SPOCK: I submit, Captain, that I am the more qualified subject. 
SPOCK: My knowledge of computers for one thing. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. Captain? 
SPOCK: I believe you will find ten cc's adequate. 
SPOCK: I presume you are the planet's master computer. 
SPOCK: As intelligent as you are, I am afraid you are labouring under some misconception. 
SPOCK: Consider all you could learn from the many species you might entertain without travelling the galaxy. 
SPOCK: I would find it most interesting, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: It appears shore leave has already commenced for certain members of the crew. 
SPOCK: The implication is that there is something else on this planet. Perhaps something intelligent. 
SPOCK: The rain forest is especially thick in his district. Life on this planet appears to be geologically younger than one would expect, given the age of this star. 
SPOCK: He won't get far in there. 
SPOCK: He would have had to go through here to escape. 
SPOCK: They might to another Pandronian, Captain. I believe he went that way, Captain. On the other hand 
SPOCK: It appears to be a native food-gathering party. 
SPOCK: These are not Enterprise communicators, Captain. They are fakes. Excellent, but non-working forgeries. 
SPOCK: Our phasers don't work either. 
SPOCK: An alternate course of action would appear to be advisable. 
SPOCK: One of us could go back to contact Mister Scott. 
SPOCK: These aborigines appear to be in a late primitive state. Obviously intelligent, they seem to have a basic language and social structure. I would assume fairly well developed mores and traditions as well. 
SPOCK: This is how you observe, by being captured? 
SPOCK: I assume that's a rhetorical question, Captain, not requiring an answer. 
SPOCK: Fate, Captain. Fate. 
SPOCK: I believe that is the correct Earth term. 
SPOCK: Captain, I am only a Vulcan. There are limits. 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
SPOCK: Remarkable. Commander Bem is a colony creature. 
SPOCK: I doubt we'll be able to do so without being seen, Captain. 
SPOCK: We're held in stasis, Captain. 
SPOCK: The job of librarian would be no less challenging, Captain, but it would undoubtedly be a lot less dangerous. 
SPOCK: Captain, perhaps we can attract the attention of the alien intelligence and reason with it. 
SPOCK: Perhaps an offering of some sort, Captain. 
SPOCK: Hmm. If we connect our two communicators in series, we can give off a high energy burst which might work, but it will also render the communicators powerless in a very short time. 
SPOCK: Captain, I compliment you on a wise decision. 
SPOCK: Fascinating, Captain. A highly advanced alien entity using this particular system as a laboratory for guiding another race to intelligence. Almost a god, you might say. 
SPOCK: According to this, Doctor McCoy was responsible for a plague which ravaged the planet Dramia Two some nineteen years ago, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, you're becoming emotional. 
SPOCK: The termination of your inoculation programme and the subsequent outbreak of plague could have been coincidence, Doctor. 
SPOCK: What now, Captain? 
SPOCK: No, Captain. The historical records of this solar system are spotty, at best, going back nineteen years. Mostly they're technical data, meteor showers, auroras, radiation reports. 
SPOCK: Plague, Dramia Two. Of unknown origin, characterised by pigmentation changes in skin of victim, debilitation, death. Certain species known to have natural immunity, notably Vulcan. Hmm. Interesting. 
SPOCK: You're planning something, Captain? 
SPOCK: Of course, Captain. 
SPOCK: You are a stowaway, Commander. 
SPOCK: Decidedly non-lethal, however. 
SPOCK: Decidedly. There's a difference, Captain. 
SPOCK: Surely you're not an outsider, Commander. You're Dramian. 
SPOCK: Not likely, Captain. 
SPOCK: Caution would seem to be advisable, Captain. 
SPOCK: The pigmentation changes associated with the disease in our computer records, Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: Yes, Captain? 
SPOCK: Clean, fed, in good health, and resting. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain. 
SPOCK [OC]: The trial may be academic. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Kol-Tai is turning blue. 
SPOCK: He's hardly fit to testify at the trial, Captain. 
SPOCK: Captain, you're blue. 
SPOCK: Captain's log, stardate 5276.4. We are in orbit around the planet Dramia, under the conditions of general quarantine. As Commanding Office, I have ordered the activation of General Order Six. 
SPOCK: General Order Six has been activated? 
SPOCK: Good. Report to Sickbay, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: I assure you I am capable, Mister Sulu. 
SPOCK: Captain, your condition. 
SPOCK: This is the Enterprise. I must speak with the Supreme Prefect. 
SPOCK: The Captain and all of the crew members are incapacitated. The plague is aboard the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: The same. You must release Doctor McCoy temporarily. He is needed to find an antidote. 
SPOCK: We have a witness in McCoy's behalf. You must trust me. 
SPOCK: Impossible. He too is stricken. 
SPOCK: If you'll permit me, Captain, I might be able to get McCoy. 
SPOCK: I can't infect the planet, Captain. And I can get McCoy. 
SPOCK: Later, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Doctor, just come with me, please. 
SPOCK: Doctor, you will stand trial, you will find out, after you've found and antidote for the plague which is about to kill everyone aboard the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: You wouldn't give me a chance. You realise, Doctor, if you go, and fail to find an antidote, you too will die. 
SPOCK: Beam us aboard, Captain. 
SPOCK: Negative, Doctor. The file on all known diseases doesn't recognise these symptoms of pigmentation changes. 
SPOCK [OC]: That's it, Doctor. The colour change symptoms were misleading the computer. 
SPOCK [OC]: Which brought on the particular plague just as this aurora has brought it on. 
SPOCK: That's the problem, Doctor. There is no known antidote. However, Doctor, do you remember a certain Kol-Tai? A man you treated for Saurian virus? 
SPOCK: Possibly nothing. However, Kol-Tai did survive the first plague. 
SPOCK: I presume, Doctor, that you have a supply of live Saurian virus antibodies in your laboratory? 
SPOCK: Including, I would hope, some of that monotonous, old dispensing of the regular vitamin rations to the crew. 
SPOCK: Well, you have been derelict in your duties of late, Doctor. 
SPOCK: Hippocrates would not have approved of lame excuses, Doctor. 
SPOCK: All systems affirmative, Captain. The Enterprise is on course and on schedule. 
SPOCK: You wished to see me, sir? 
SPOCK: I trust it will not affect our scheduled arrival at Deneb Five. 
SPOCK: Will that be all, Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, that won't be necessary. I'm quite able 
SPOCK: Anything else, sir? 
SPOCK: I was conserving energy, Captain. 
SPOCK: An unnecessary assurance, Doctor, in addition to being untrue. 
SPOCK: Such restraint would be welcome. 
SPOCK: Thank you, Doctor. 
SPOCK: No, sir. They hadn't reached it. 
SPOCK: The Huron's power levels are at bare minimum for life support, Captain. I'm picking up metallic debris. 
SPOCK: Based on present data, I would say yes. 
SPOCK: Captain, I (collapses) 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy, I 
SPOCK: Nothing but Doctor McCoy's gloating. 
SPOCK: I still prefer my physiological structure to yours. 
SPOCK: Romulans, Captain. They were apparently lying in wait on the far side of that asteroid. 
SPOCK: Captain, the Romulan ships are overtaking us. At close range our deflectors will be unable to repel their attack. 
SPOCK: Strange. It's not on the charts. 
SPOCK: The field is composed of highly charged subatomic particles. If the density grows no worse we should be able to ride it out. 
SPOCK: It appears we're all victims of a rather bizarre coincidence. The odds against something like this happening are astronomical. 
SPOCK: Curious, very curious. 
SPOCK: Captain, I found this device on my console. It seems to serve no useful function, and 
SPOCK: Captain? 
SPOCK: Captain, I never laugh. 
SPOCK: It appears to be a legitimate fog. Perhaps the humidification system is 
SPOCK: Amazing. This deck is covered with ice. 
SPOCK: The evidence all points to one guilty party, Captain. 
SPOCK: Not who, what. I believe our practical joker is the Enterprise itself. 
SPOCK: Precisely. 
SPOCK [OC]: All hands to your stations. This is a general alert. Repeat, all hands to your 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Question. Why are we unable to communicate with crewmembers McCoy, Sulu and Uhura? 
SPOCK: Affirmative. The dysfunction is more severe than I thought. Question. Are you deliberately holding our missing crewmembers prisoner? 
SPOCK: I suggest compliance, Captain. 
SPOCK: An obvious defensive manoeuvre by the computer. 
SPOCK: I have a theory, Captain, but first I suggest that if Officer Scott moves away from the computer, it might feel less threatened. 
SPOCK: You recall that energy field we passed through? 
SPOCK: Apparently, subatomic particles from that field have invaded our computer's circuits, much like bacteria infect living matter. As a result, the Enterprise is suffering the electronic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid I don't know, Captain. Its illogical behaviour precludes a logical solution. 
SPOCK: Hmm. Just as I thought. 
SPOCK: Our air is being pumped full of nitrous oxide. Better known as laughing gas. But it's no laughing matter, especially for Vulcans. 
SPOCK: Captain, we're underway. 
SPOCK: We're heading back to the Neutral Zone. 
SPOCK: Sensors are picking up three ships, Captain. Magnification shows them to be Romulan warships. 
SPOCK: The Romulan ships have halted their attack. Apparently the sight of a spacecraft twenty times their size has given them second thoughts. 
SPOCK: Please elaborate, Captain. 
SPOCK: Are you suggesting that the Enterprise is seeking revenge? 
SPOCK: The Romulans are giving chase. 
SPOCK: And I'm getting normal function in all computer modes. That last pass through the energy field apparently reversed all effects. 
SPOCK: The trail is becoming fainter, Captain. I recommend we reduce speed to accommodate our sensors. 
SPOCK: No readings yet, Captain. Possibly a second probe. 
SPOCK: None as yet, sir. But sensors now indicate it is twice our size. Vessel appears extremely unorthodox in design. And Starfleet lists no other authorised vessels in this quadrant. 
SPOCK: Approaching ship has an immense energy field surrounding it. Fascinating. Readings indicate the vessel is composed entirely of crystalline ceramic. I would almost say 
SPOCK: We have been encased in a globular force field, Captain. The source is the approaching vessel. 
SPOCK: It is a force globe, but one that is flexible enough to absorb any force. I cannot explain it. Clearly we cannot escape by simply fleeing. Sensors indicate we at now being probed. 
SPOCK: Evasive action will not be effective, Captain. The force globe limits our manoeuvreing. 
SPOCK: Still approaching, Captain. Going sublight. It continues to probe us. Its surrounding energy pattern is now shifting. 
SPOCK: Captain, library computer confirms that Ensign Walking Bear is correct. The Mayas had a legend of a winged serpent god who came from the skies, bringing knowledge. Such legends were not uncommon among Earth's peoples, Captain. 
SPOCK: Entirely possible. 
SPOCK: Captain. 
SPOCK: Lieutenant Uhura, you are supposed to be monitoring the alien vessel. Our first priority is to free the Enterprise and ourselves. Return to your duties. 
SPOCK: Of course. The elasticity of the force field can respond in only one direction at a time. All hands to battle stations. Full impulse power, helmsman. Tractor beam on, full power. Warp engines on standby. Mister Arex, prepare to compensate for warp catapult effect. When we break free, we will be thrown approximately five point six nine eight light years. 
SPOCK: The force globe is flexible in only one direction per unit of time. We shall both push and pull on it simultaneously. It should become rigid enough for a burst of warp power to shatter it. 
SPOCK: Full warp power on my order. Now. 
SPOCK: Reverse engines and come about. Lay in spiral evasive course for Kukulkan's ship. 
SPOCK: Interesting, Captain. The creature was the Mayan god from the ancient legends. 
SPOCK: Not legends, Doctor. Fact. Vulcan was visited by alien beings. They left much wiser. 
SPOCK: Indeed, Captain. 
SPOCK: Excuse me, Captain. You asked to be notified when we made visual contact with the Beta Niobe nova. 
SPOCK: We're travelling at a safe distance from the nova, Mrs. April. 
SPOCK: Captain, sensors are picking up an unidentified object travelling at an incredible speed, presently on collision course with the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: At a speed that should be impossible to achieve. Something on the order of warp thirty six. 
SPOCK: I believe it is not a natural object, but a ship. 
SPOCK: No known race, Captain. Nevertheless, it will contact us in one point four minutes. 
SPOCK: Correction, Captain. The ship was on a collision course only by coincidence. It is apparently heading for the heart of the Beta Niobe nova. 
SPOCK: Three minutes forty two point seven seconds. 
SPOCK: Our speed is now warp twenty, and the other ship will contact the nova in one minute fifty eight point three seconds. 
SPOCK: We are up to warp twenty two and increasing, Captain. We shall have forty two point eight five seconds to correct our course after the alien ship enters the nova. 
SPOCK: The alien vessel will contact Beta Niobe in fifty two point three seconds, Captain. 
SPOCK: Contact in thirty nine seconds. Thirty eight, thirty seven 
SPOCK: Thirteen, twelve, eleven 
SPOCK: And we are still increasing speed. Contact with the nova in thirty five point one eight seconds. 
SPOCK: Contact in twenty seconds. 
SPOCK: Fourteen seconds, thirteen, twelve 
SPOCK: Captain, the flower is not the only thing on board that is growing younger. 
SPOCK: Ship's chronometers are also running backward. The flow of time is reversed in this universe. The longer we stay here, the younger we will become. 
SPOCK: Apparently our brains are also working in reverse, Captain, so we can now understand her language. That is why the ship seems to be operating in the reverse to us. 
SPOCK: It is logical that we must reproduce the conditions that brought us here. Two novas must occupy the same space in both universes in order to create a gateway for us to travel through. One star dying in our universe, and one being born here would recreate the correct conditions. 
SPOCK: Most logical. If the flow of time is reversed, then one is born at an old age, and dies in infancy. Your descendants are born before you, and your ancestors are born after you. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. Apparently the two universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions. 
SPOCK: Correct, Commodore. Now if you'll watch the star map, you'll see the Milky Way. Here is Beta Niobe, and here is Earth. It corresponds exactly with Arret. By superimposing both star maps, we will see where two stars occupy the same place in both universes. The red spheres indicate where two stars are in the same space. No pair are novas in both universes. 
SPOCK: That's true, Captain. 
SPOCK: We can't use her ship to transport us, Captain, but we could use it as an unmanned ship with our tractor beam attached. 
SPOCK: Eighteen minutes thirty seven seconds in real time. But long before that we shall all be children. And, Captain, that also means we are losing our knowledge at an alarming rate. It is possible we will soon be unable to operate the Enterprise. 
SPOCK: He's too young, Captain. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain, but who will fill in for you? 
SPOCK: At what age did you become a starship captain? And when did you enter Starfleet Academy? 
SPOCK: As a Vulcan, I age the slowest. I will be capable of assuming command longer than anyone else. But even I will become too young to know what to do. 
SPOCK: Ten minutes fourteen point twenty one seconds, Captain. We shall arrive with only moments to spare. We will need to disconnect the tractor beam at the appropriate time. 
SPOCK: Captain, I must assume command. You are no longer able to command the Enterprise.
SPOCK: You are correct, of course. Commodore April, command is yours. 
SPOCK: Yes, Captain. 
SPOCK: The dead star is directly ahead, Captain, twelve degrees south of galactic plane. 
SPOCK: Vessel armed, Captain. Nine seconds to impact. Eight, seven, 
SPOCK: Three, two
